An early archive version of

    Columbia's Gaming Library
    http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Lair/2370/index.html
    http://www.simons.demon.nl/

One of the very first websites I made.

Started in February 1998:

    https://github.com/lsimons/columbos-gaming-library/tree/c4b648485381e104732e417d7fdc923dfb4b80e8

then kept updated through early 1998.

The site got too popular for my hosting provider to support.

Most of the content eventually got moved into

    AtFantasy
    http://atfantasy.com/

which made it into the Wayback Machine ok, for example
