<B><FONT SIZE=+3>ADND on the internet: finding what you need</FONT></B><BR>

<P>This page is here for those who are looking for adnd material on the internet,
but do not know where to start or how to find the right sites. It highlights
various of the adnd features you can find out there, as well as providing links
to the most useful adnd sites.</P>

<P>The best thing to do is safe this page to your disk, and then read it offline.
Look at all the cool stuff, and browse to the pages you find most attractive.
This page gives links to only a small part of the adnd sites, and is by no means
intended to be objective.</P>

<P>If you are interested in creating your own ADND page, <A HREF="adnd_start_page.htm">
click here</A> for suggestions on how to do so.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>the TSR website</FONT></B><BR>

<P>THE place to start is <A HREF="http://www.tsr.com">TSR's own website</A>.
You can find many nice stuff here, for most of their campaign settings, as well
as for general adnd stuff. But that's only the beginning.<BR>
The TSR website has a great chat system, which is totally free. Then there is a
large archive with old dungeon material, as well as articles from dragon magazine.
There's a link to TSRs online catalog, which has descriptions of all their new
releases. The address for this site is<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.tsr.com">http://www.tsr.com</A></P>
<HR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>the ADND mailing lists</FONT></B><BR>

<P>A cool thing to do is subscribe to one or more of the adnd mailing lists. When
you join a mailing list, you can send an e-mail to a server, which then forwards
this mail to all the members of the list. Similarly, you recieve the mails
other members of the list send to it. This system works very well; it is primarily
used for announcements about different topics, as well as for discussions on various
subjects.</P>

<P>The mailing lists often have well over a 100 members. Many of them are DMs, and
all these people share one interest: adnd. The lists can thus be used to work
together with dozens of people. Together, these can work on projects, using the
mailing list, and often message boards, and produce more than any one man (or woman)
ever could. After all, even TSR products aren't written by 50 people...</P>

<P>More information about subscribing to the various lists can be found in the adnd
section of the <A HREF="http://www.tsr.com">TSR site</A>.</P>
<HR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>the ADND Netbooks</FONT></B><BR>

<P>There are a large number of adnd netbooks online. Basically, there is someone who
decides to make a collection of traps, monsters, spells, or whatever. He gathers them
from webpages, and asks others for submissions. The result is a large tome with useful
stuff.</P>

<P>The most famous netbook is The Great Netbook of Spells. This tome has existed for a
long time now, and contains more than 1000 (!) spells for wizards of all levels. With
this tome, you don't need the Wizard's Spell Compendium no more! You can get the
Netbook of Spells at various locations, in various formats.<BR>
Here's a link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.math.auth.gr/~bchr/netbooks/wi_wfw6.zip">Netbook of Spells, word 6 format</A><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.math.auth.gr/~bchr/netbooks/wi_asc.zip">Netbook of Spells, ASCII</A></B></P>

Similar, there is the Netbook of Prayers, which is dedicated to priest spells.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.math.auth.gr/~bchr/PR_WFW6.zip">The Great Net Prayerbook version 6 (word 6)</A><BR> 
<A HREF="http://www.math.auth.gr/~bchr/PR_ASC.zip">The Great Net Prayerbook version 6 (ascii)</A></B></P>

<P>But these are really only the top of the iceberg. There is a netbook of plots, riddles,
traps, classes and kits, alcohol, dark sun, and many more. You can find almost all of these
at <A HREF="http://home.sol.no/~olear/ADnD.html">Olik's Archive</A>, an absolutely terrific
site with tons and tons of adnd material.</P>
<HR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>the RPG Archive and other indexes</FONT></B><BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/2407/archive.html">The RPG Archive</A>
is a very large site, with links to over 700(!) sites. These are all rpg sites, and most
of them are adnd. No other index site comes close to the amount of sites the Archive has.</P>

<P>However, the Archive doesn't use modern technologies for linking the sites up, and it
has descriptions of only a few sites. Therefore, many people opt to go to one of the other
index sites on the internet. I personally favour the Archive, as its the oldest and largest.
Beyond that, I will not favour any of the other index pages that can be found. Instead, I
just give the link: (listed in no particular order)</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>the ADND Webrings</FONT></B><BR>

<P>A great feature online is the webring. How it works isn't really interesting for you,
just how to use it. A webring consists of similar pages that have a link to each other.
By following the ring, you can view a whole range of sites.</P>

<P>There are several adnd webrings. I have selected a few of them, and give you adresses
for the home sites of these webrings. From there, you can browse through the rings.</P>

<P><UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="http://www.furness1.demon.co.uk/adndring/">The ADND ring</A></B>. This ring
links up pages that relate to ADND in general.
<LI><B><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/3297/ring_of_worlds.html">The Ring of Worlds</A></B>.
This ring links up pages with imaginary worlds. These aren't limited to adnd, but most of them
are written for adnd or are easily modified to use with adnd.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>My site</FONT></B><BR>

<P>Of course, I will advertise for <A HREF="http://www.simons.demon.nl">my own site</A> here as well. You can go to the main page
by clicking on the index link at the top of this page. Besides my own campaign world,
adnd rule modifications and various aids, I also have a nice links page, that has links
to a lot of good sites.</P>
<HR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Want to be a better DM?</FONT></B><BR>
<P>I have written down some of my ideas on how to successfully DM a campaign. Read the
advice of a DM with years of experience in designing campaigns adn adventures! Find
my essays, as well as those of others, by <A HREF="/adnd_dm_aid.htm">going here</A>.
