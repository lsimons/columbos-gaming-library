<I><P>'Many people just rely on the rules given by the Creators, the
lords of <A HREF="www.tsrinc.com">TSR</A>. But there are many more
rules in this universe, which are often even better than the rules
of the creators. Here I give you the best.'</P></I>

<P><B><A HREF="combat.zip">Mass Combat System</A></B><BR>
These rules of my own creation give you a complete, fast, easy,
smooth and realistic system for playing out combats between large
armies. Covers all tactics and troop types in a few pages.<BR>

<P><B><A HREF="advent.zip">Adventurer Rules</A></B><BR>
Shortly said, these easy rules allow you to create an adventurer
with ANY combination of abilities you want. Using character points,
these rules give you more options than the class creation rules in
the DMG.<BR>

<P><B><A HREF="http://onyx.arts.kuleuven.ac.be/~ezra/gnba/books/~olear/ADnD/Files/TUCS_RTF.zip">Time Unit Combat System (RTF)</A></B><BR>
These rules do away with the classical round system. Instead, combat
just flows from second to second. Fast and fluent rules. I wonder why
the Creators never thought of this.<BR>

<P><B><A HREF="tucs.zip">Time Unit Combat System 2</A></B><BR>
These rules do away with the classical round system. Instead, combat
just flows from second to second. Fast and fluent rules. I wonder why
the Creators never thought of this. This is my version of the rules,
with a few changes, and written for the combat and tactics combat
system (I'd say they're better, but that's my humble opinion.)<BR>

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Lair/2370/psi_liv.zip">Psionics and Living Items</A></B><BR>
While originally written specifically for Dark Sun, these rules can be
used with any campaign. There are rule modificiations to psionics, and
rules on an entirely new concept: living items.<BR>

This needs little explaining: over 250 new proficiencies.<BR>

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.tsrinc.com/adndcore/CASTLE.ZIP">TSR #2112, The Castle Guide</A></B><BR>
You can download the castle guide from TSR's website. Very bad
formatting, but official!<BR>
