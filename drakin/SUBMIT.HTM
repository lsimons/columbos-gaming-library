<P>Currently, Zal is busy building his own site about the Dragon Kings
world. This site, which will be named "Drako's Tomb", will feature
his own material, as well as translations of my material into
Spanish. If you're interested in hosting your own Drakin page,
<A HREF="MAILTO:columbo@simons.demon.nl">drop a line</A>, and we'll
discuss it. Remember, ANY help is welcome!</P>
<P>Also, a great man named Vincent will do translations of eventually
everything into french. He has also offered to draw some decent maps
using Campaign Carthographer.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT> would just love any material you write
on the World of Drakin. Of course you will get full credit for your
work, and I will include your name, e-mail and url on this page if
you so desire. I can view most image files (haven't come across one I
can't view), as well as most documents. (including WordPerfect, Wordpro
or Word (up to 95).)</P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT> would greatly appreciate it if you could use the same format I have
used for the campaign guide and the other documents (simply <I>select
all</I>, and then <I>delete</I>. What is left can be used as a
document template).</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT> Recieve a lot of mails from people who
ask me what I'm looking for. Basically, ANYTHING (quite literally) that
somehow relates to the World of Drakin is welcome. I'll gladly host
other material as well...<BR>
What I would like most is more details on DragonMountain. Basically,
anything as small as a one-paragraph description of an NPC that lives
in the city is welcome.</P>
