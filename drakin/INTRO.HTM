<TD>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he idea for the World of Drakin has
slowly grown within me from the moment I acquired the DMG. But I decided
my project idea was way to hard for me as a starting DM. And so I made
other worlds. One was based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, in another
one I used ideas from "Wizard of Earthsea".
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>A</B></FONT>fter more worlds and much learning, I purchased the Dark Sun box, for
only one reason: it had dragons in command. I have DMed several Dark
Sun campaigns, and I still play with it at times.
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>t was when my experienced players started asking me for some
high-level intrigue and wars, that my original idea for Drakin was
ready for development. I started working on the world, while
experimenting with high-level play in an old world, where I was free
to try out what worked and what did not, because it didn't matter if I
screwed it up.
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>W</B></FONT>hen I asked my players to roll up characters for a new world, I had
written about 75 pages of typed A4s of information on the world.
After a few adventures that got the players drawn into the world, I
started working on what I would later name "The Quest Series".
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he Dragon Kings campaign setting takes place in the Known World, a
small area, about 1000 times 700 miles. This area is inhabited by all
the common adnd races. Humans are the dominant race, with the
goblinoids not far behind. The other races are less prevalent and most
are only commonly found in restricted areas. All these races worship
the same god, though under different names and with different
religions. The most powerful religion is that of the Church. Most
people are members of the Church, and obey the priests of the Church. 
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>his Church has its own nation, called the Land of Faith. Here, the
religious monarchy is in control of almost anything. Besides the Land
of Faith, almost half of all the land in other countries is the
property of the Church.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he other nations are all ruled by powerful dragons. These are really
wizards who have successfully cast a Dragon Metamorphosis spell. This
spell connects them to either the positive or negative energy plane,
and thus grants them many magical powers, as well as immortality.
Their alignments are either totally good or utter evil. The dragons
rule their countries in various ways. Most are simple dictators, whilst
others let the nobles of the world manage government.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>hese noble families are numerous and often still very powerful. Before
the rise of the dragons, they were absolute rulers. These nobles are
essentially like the nobles of medieval europe, with a dragon as an
all-powerful king ruling them. A fragile military and political
balance exists between Church, dragons and nobles.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he Known World is bordered by a large sea in the west and south. To
he north there are the Endless Swamps, inhabited by the dangerous
warrior creatures known as klingons. These klingons are a continous
threat to the Known World, like orcs are in standard adnd to the human
nations.<BR>
To the east, there is a range of high mountains inhabited by dangerous
creatures. Beyond that, there is a vast desert that's almost
uninhabitable. Because of these natural borders, the people of the
Known World have not explored much of Drakin.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he starting adventure spot for the Dragon Kings campaign is the city
of DragonMountain. This city-state is the only nation that is ruled
by normal humans. This unique position, together with its great trading
position, has made this city one where activity never stops, as well
as a place where thieves and other dangers are numerous.
