will take some time...</P>

<P>'<FONT SIZE=+2><B>O</B></FONT>nce upon a time, in the ancient past, even before there was magic,
before there was psionics, there was water. The whole surface of Athas
was covered with water. In a small area, which is know called "The Tyr
Region", there was a great civilization of halflings.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>W</B></FONT>hen this civilization came to an end, the seas dissapeared, to make
place for Green Forest. Many new races were born, and these races built
great cities. On the ruins of ancient Nibenay, a new city was founded.
The law-enforcers of  this city were undead, created by the combined
efforts of priests and psionicists. These guardians were called Meorty.
After the Magic and The Cleansing Wars came, the land withered to
desert, and the great cities became ruins. The undead, still exist
however, to enforce the ancient laws, bound by their undead curse.
I, Morgreth, am the law-enforcer of Nibenay.</P>
