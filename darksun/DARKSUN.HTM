<P><I><FONT SIZE=+2><B>A</B></FONT>s you open the old wooden door, you hear an old, low voice
whispering to you:<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>H</B></FONT>ow nice of you to come all the way from the surface to visit me,
in my modest home. You are my guests. Behind a large wooden desk sits
an ancient undead creature, the size of a human. It rizes from behind
the desk, and speaks to you:"I am Morgreth, the first law-keeper of
Lower Nibenay. Welcome."</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he Dark Sun campaign setting is my favourite one from TSR. I've run
several campaigns on Athas, and have written quite some material about
the world and its inhabitants myself. You will find the best of it 
here.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>A</B></FONT>thas is a desert world. Centuries of defiling spells used by evil
sorcerors and dragons has turned this once forest-covered world into
wasteland. The people of Athas live in city states that used to be
ruled by powerful sorceror kings. The adventures and novels written
for Dark Sun have seen the death of some of these half-dragons.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he Dark Sun product line is currently on a halt, though the Dark Sun
Revised Boxed Set will be re-released somewhere in 1999. Meanwhile, the
Dark Sun online community keeps the dark sun setting alive. There are
dozens of dark sun pages on the net, far more than there are for
any other world.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT> have previously maintained two dark sun pages: first
the Wanderer's Home, later the Crypt. Now, the material from these
sites can be found here, together with the keeper of that material,
known only as Morgreth.</P>

there is an adaption of DS character generation rules for the Skills
and Powers book. Secondly, there are the additional rules needed to
use the Adventurer Rules with DS.<BR>
And there is more, of course.

city in most campaigns I've run in DS. Here is some of my material on
the city.
