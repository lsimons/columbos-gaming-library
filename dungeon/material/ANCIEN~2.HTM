<HR>

<P>
The Old Park section is one of the few parts of the original city
that remains. Though the Founders are gone, their influence is
everywhere over the place until the present day.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc424121834">History</A></H2>

<P>
Once, this area was the center for all activity. It had clean
corridors and many shops and other places where amusement could
be found. In addition, this section of the city had a very large,
beautiful park, with artificial light and a large variety of plants.
<P>
More important, this was (and is) the place where the main core
of the dungeon brain was located. Here, the Founders could talk
with the dungeon, and check if there was any need for 'maintenance'.
<P>
As a result of these two factors, and as a result of the Founder's
love of nature, the park became sort of a place for Founders from
all across the city to gather. This made it necessary to expand
the park even further, to accommodate all the creatures. A forest
was added, as well as a small river, waterfall, lake and a gladiatorial
arena.
<P>
When the Destroyers killed the Founders, and later died themselves,
there was nobody left to care for the area or the park. The shops,
corridors and other buildings slowly turned into ruins, and the
park slowly turned into a wild forest.
<P>
The core of the dungeon's brain remained more or less as it was
before the extinction of the Founders. As the main brain, it was
the only one able to see what happened in all the other sections.
Instead of gating in newcomers, the brain decided to stop interfering
completely, letting nature have its way.
<P>
Through the connections with the other sections, creatures came
here. A large variety of races and monsters settled here. Some
of them, like the drow, have striven to control the area. When
these groups became too powerful, the dungeon brain solved this
by gating in a group of adventurers to stop this threat. None
of the good-aligned races have tried to control this dungeon yet,
and the reaction of the dungeon to such an attempt is unknown.
<P>
In the past, there have been neighborhood wars between different
races that involved the entire section. Currently, there is a
bit more rest, after the renowned doctor Columbo and his party
stopped a group of shapechangers that were close to destroying
the other races.
<P>
Undoubtly, there will be disputes over the section again, and
blood will again be shed.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc424121835">Physics, Magics and Psionics</A></H2>

<P>
This dungeon section closely resembles the environment as found
on most primes. There are some remarkable differences though,
next to those described in the general dungeon description.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121836">The Law of Time Relativity</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Time is a strange dimension. It flows differently in different
places. In the Ancient City, it flows slower. In relation to the
other parts of the dungeon, a month spent in the Old Park is only
a week in another area.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121837">The Law of Decreased Decay</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Next to the time flowing slower, all non-organic material (buildings,
iron tools, etc.), as well as the dungeon itself, is almost immune
to decay due to ageing. This means that the buildings here are
still largely intact, though many have been damaged by the inhabitants
of the dungeon.
<P>
To be precise, the wearing of non-organic material occurs at only
1/100 of the normal rate. In combination with the slower time
flow, this means that materials wear away in one year in the rest
of the dungeon last for 400 years in the Old Park.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121838">The Law of Sky</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
The Old Park was a place of luxery, with comfort not many could
afford for themselves. All public areas (thus, the large corridors)
are made to resemble windows, through which you can see a sky.
This sky has a day and a night cirkle, repeating every 26 hours.
In addition, there is difference in colouring and sun per day
according to the current season. For ease, use the earth calendar
when figuring out the light and sky colour.
<P>
Though this simulates a sky pattern, it is in no way the same,
and any prolonged stay will reveal this. Note also that any chambers
or small corridors do not have this kind of ceiling.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121839">The Law of Wind</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Many plants rely upon the wind to spread their seeds. To make
this possible, an elaborate enchantment was devised, that expanded
on the law of air. A gentle breese goes through the corridors
and the park; the 'shop section' does not have these winds. Windspeed
varies from 0 to 10 mph.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121840">The Law of Lost Magic</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Ancient enchantments placed by the dungeon itself amke sure that
any spell cast here will not function at the highest power level.
In effect, spells with levle-variable durations/effects are cast
as though the caster ws 11th level. Spells above 7th level do
not function at all.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121841">The Law Of Psionic Control</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
The dungeon brain drains one point of psionic energy every hour,
instead of a half point. In addition, a psionicist wishin to use
a psionic attack or defense must pay twice the normal PSP cost.
<P>
If someone in some way attempts to harm the dungeon itself, especially
the dungeon brain, this can increase to 200 or more points per
minute, causing a severe headache at least and possibly death.
There are no known means to prevent this draining.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc424121842">Climate, Ecology, Geographic Notes</A>
</H2>

<P>
The climate in the entire section was designed to be comfortable
to the Founders. This means a temperature that is constant at
26 degrees celsius (79&#186; F). The humidity varies between 20
and 40%, so the air is comfortable to humans and most demihuman
races.
<P>
Note that the below applies mostly to the forest and other areas
with a lot of vegetation; this material is not for the city area.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121843">Plant Growth</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
The air, wind and light enchantments, together with the miniature
tempests that roam the area, create a micro-climate that supports
all these plants. One can find all the trees and plants that can
be expected to dwell in such a climate, as well as a swamp, clutches
of palm trees&#133;the area was designed to hold a large variety
of plants.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121844">Animal Life</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Likewise, the animal life in this area is as varied. All sorts
of non-magical, magical and not-so-magical-but-with-some-ability
creatures can be found. You will not find any creatures that cannot
survive in a temperate to sub-tropical climate.
<P>
Common animals include hinds and other deer, foxes, wild boars,
rabbits, a variety of birds, and more. Most of these creatures
are relatively nondangerous. You will not find bears (or owlbears),
wolves, tigers, or lions.
<P>
Next to the common animals, there is a new creature the human
residents call Tirk. A tirk is a small, apelike creature, with
a large snout, like an ant-eater. They are basically harmless,
living of, surprisingly, ants and other insects. Tirks are known
to steal food and shiny objects (especially gems) from those that
roam the forest. I suspect the Founders once helt the Tirks as
pets.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121845">Water</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
There are three sources of water: the Prismatic Fountain, the
Neired, a river, and the Golden Lake, which is fed by water from
the Neired.
<P>
In addition, the strange creatures I have named Lesser Water Tempests
live in the park. These elemental creatures seem to be related
in some way to their larger cousins. A logical explanation for
their existance seems to be that they were bred by the Founders
to sustain the plant life, a task they still fullfil.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121846">Geography</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
For ease, I shall divide the Ancient City in two: the building
section and the forest section. Also for ease, I shall use the
directional parameters north, south, west and east, although these
don't really make sense (since nobody has ever proven the dungeon
has a north or south pole, and this is highly unlikely).
<P>
The northerwestern part of the dungeon is the building section.
This area is around 700x300 meters square, and consists basically
of only one main level, and numerous small sublevels. The area
is square-sized, and the southwestern part of this square is a
steep cliff that goes down 50-60 meters, to the bottom of the
forest section. Gigantic stairs lead down into the forest below.
<P>
The forest area is many times larger, the distances here measured
in miles. It is shaped more like an ovale, and strectches 15 miles
from southwest to northeast, and half that from west to southeast.
<H4>
<CENTER>
The Neired
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
The Neired river flows from the most western part of the dungeon,
all the way down to the eastern corner of the forest section.
In the building section, the river flows slowly, due to the horizontal
way this area is built. Then, it falls down in a large waterfall
for 60 meters, to continue a winding path through the forest.
<P>
In the building area, the depth of the Neired varies from 10 to
20 feet, and the river is about 20 meters wide. In the forest
section, the river depth is around 25 feet, though it is a mere
5 feet in some places. The width here varies from 10 to 50 meters.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc424121847">Architecture</A></H2>

<P>
The Founders apparantly loved to simulate more primitive cultures.
Almost everything in the Ancient City is built from massive blocks
of stone, carefully cut to fit together, without using cement.
Those of you that have been on Terra will see a remarkable resemblance
with Egyptian architecture, though that might just be a coincidence.
<P>
I will assume that, since you will probably get this material
from my scribe  Leo, you can accurately imagine what the Ancient
City looks like, as this means you live on Terra. Therefore, I
will not waste time and space on a mostly boring subject.
<P>
Instead, I will just quickly highlight two differences between
the constructions of the Founders and ancient Egypt.
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121848">Doors</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Most doors here look the same. Basically, they are sliding metal
panels that dissapear into the wall when opened. Try to imagine
what it looks like, looking at the following description:
<P>
<I>&quot;You stand before a somewhat strange door. It is made
of solid metal of a kind unknown to you. Apparantly, it slides
away into the wall, instead of opening normally. The door is about
7 feet high, and 5 wide. It appears to have no lock.</I>
<P>
<I>Four small hinges, just large enough to get 3 fingers through,
are smithed unto the door, 2 feet above the ground, to the right.
Above these rings, there are some incomprehensible runes, similar
to the ones that appear throughout the dungeon.&quot;</I>
<P>
Most of these doors are not locked. Those that are can be opened
by briefly touching the right runes on the door panel (see below).
<P>
The runes, when translated, give a mostly useless name; probably
these mention who used to live there.
<P>
Note that the only places you find doors are between public and
private areas, and sometimes to guard treasure rooms or other
important rooms. Elsewhere, the Founders probably deemed doors
unneccessary (the current inhabitants use curtains between quarters).
<H3>
<CENTER>
<A NAME="_Toc424121849">Runic Panels</A>
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
These devices can be found throughout the Ancient City. They are
simple black panels, with several runes inscribed in the stone
around them. These runes light up when pressed.
<P>
If one uses the right combination of runes, a door may open. It
is also possible to call up some kind of map of the city, though
this map isn't very accurate or correct. I do not know the right
runes to do this, but have seen others do so.
<P>
When you use the panel this way, a minatiature version of the
Ancient City appears. It shows the major corridors, as well as
what must be their names, in the same runes found throughout the
park area. A small light glows to show your current position within
the city.
<P>
I speculate that the Founders used this marvelous combination
of science and technology for many more purposes, that are now
lost to history. Note that the runes cannot be translated; even
magic doesn't work.
<H1>What's Coming Up</H1>

<HR>

<P>
I'm working on the map. Then I'll do the major power groups, major
villains, and all other 'major' things. Then I wil get to detailed
descriptions of rooms, encounter tables, and many more. It will
take a while before you see all that, though. I would love to
hear any and all suggestions that couldhelp improve the Old Park.
