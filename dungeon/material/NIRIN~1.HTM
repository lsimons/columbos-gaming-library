<B>The Cavern of Nirin (temporary name)</B>
<P>
<B>General shape:</B>
<P>
The Cavern of Nirin is a vast cavern measuring some 19 miles from
east to west and 16 miles from north to south. The cavern is vaguely
hexagon shaped, with the western corner being stretched somewhat
away from the others. The cavern is mostly relatively flat except
for a massive rock mound/dome/hill in the centre. The dome rises
about half a mile above the surface and is shaped as an almost
regular nanogon (nine sides). The dome is about 3 miles across.
The dome is also referred to as the Pain Maze because of the terrible
maze it conceals.
<P>
<B>Vegetation/Regions:</B>
<P>
The cavern various almost as much as it's cities vary among themselves.
From the east a subterranean river, which the denizens of the
dungeon call the <B>Sine Ahad</B>, flows into the cavern (major
underwater entrance). The Sine Ahad is rich in fish and algae
and the lands where it enters the cavern are called <B>The Silts</B>.
The Silts are a large flat flood plain, where the Sine Ahad has
deposited large amounts of fine rock mud, with only little organic
material. The Silts are filled with treacherous pools, quicksand
and various strange amphibious creatures which prey on the caverns
denizens. Only one goblin road leads from the <B>River Gate</B>,
where the Sine Ahad enters the cavern to the goblin city. The
Sine Ahad splits into two when it enters <B>Flosbad Marsh</B>,
the North and the South rivers. Flosbad Marsh is a rank, wetland
filled with various beasts and carrion flooded in from upstream.
At the western end of the marsh is the goblin/orc city of <B>Crollheap</B>.
South of South river is <B>the Blasted Waste</B>, a vast area
of scorched, glassy rock and numerous slag heaps. The waste is
utterly devoid of life, and the dark city of <B>Esboran </B>(derro,
duergar...) is built in and on a large granite outcropping. A
small, filthy stream flows from the city. Further east are the
<B>Slave Fields</B> of the Drow, which are filled with vast irrigated
fields and ruled by the Drow of <B>Draboran</B>, which is protected
from the rest of the cavern by the <B>Icewall</B>, and from the
creatures that inhabit the rest of the dungeon, and occasionally
raid through the <B>South Tunnel </B>by the <B>Icegate</B>. Where
the North and South rivers meet is the lake of <B>Faln-Durham
</B>and the semi-sunken city of <B>Kua-Makiki</B>. North of the
North river, from the west, are the <B>Orcwoods, </B>a dense,
shrubby forest, which is followed by the <B>Rock Waste</B>, a
vast expanse of crumbling sandstone which ends at the <B>Dwarf
river </B>which flows from the city of <B>Khaz Muar</B>. Between
the Rock Waste and the North river are the <B>Goblin Fields, </B>worked
by goblin slaves of the giants of <B>Crac-Titan</B>, a giant stronghold
built on <B>Crac Island</B> in the middle of the North river.
<B>The Fields of Freedom </B>stretch from the <B>North Tunnel
</B>and Khaz Muar (entered by the Great Stair) to <B>Raiderwood
</B>and the stone city of <B>Myrmarra</B>. Raiderwood separates
the Slave Fields from the Fields of Freedom. Between the North
and South rivers is the <B>Old Land </B> and in the centre of
it the <B>Pain Maze</B>. The Dead Road leads from Esboran to the
surface races' city of <B>Izund</B>. The Dead road crosses the
South river on three bridges at the heart of the dead city of
<B>Sai-Sigil</B>, at the centre of which is the <B>Bone Citadel</B>.
Between Sai-Sigil and Kua-Makiki are the <B>Forgotten Fields</B>,
where no crops have grown for uncounted years. All around the
Pain Maze is the <B>Twisted Forest</B>, a forest filled with evil
and malevolence beyond belief. <B>Fort Sacros </B>guards the road
from Izund to Crac-Titan, while <B>Fort Khuz </B>guards the giant
bridge across the Dwarf river (in dwarven hands now). The Twisted
forest is bordered by the ancient stone roads of forgotten times.
Between Flosbad marsh and the Twisted Forest is an area of sulphuric
pits and dangerous hollows.
<P>
<B>The Cities</B>
<P>
The nine inhabited (well, eight) cities of Nirin are all built
on the foundations of far far older cities. The old Creators'
cities were all ruined and destroyed by the time the other race
arrived, however many of the cities' automated life support systems
still functioned. In the long years since many of the support
systems have failed and the new inhabitants have been forced to
look for food and water elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Crollheap </B>- This is probably the largest city in the cavern
of Nirin and also the dirtiest. It is inhabited by numerous goblinoid
and orcish races, with goblins and orcs being in the majority.
The city is pretty anarchic with severe street fighting and numerous
battles. Crollheap is often raided by the other cities for slaves
(or food in the case of Sai-Sigil). The three most powerful factions
in Crollheap are currently the Blue Blood Orc Clan, the Saffi
- a fanatical band of mixed descent worshipping a powerful demon
(yes, his name is Saffi) who occasionally even enters Crollheap
and finally the Gnoll Gang, a tough band of bandits and outcasts.
Although it originally consisted mostly of gnolls it now counts
among it's members more goblins, orcs and hobgoblins than gnolls.
The city spreads beyond it's ancient crumbling and ill-repaired
walls all along the edges of the Flosbad marsh, as well as onto
several islets within it. Most of the city's inhabitants are almost
permanently near starvation and death is a common and every-day
occurrence here. Crimes go unpunished and murder is a common means
of settling disputes. The cities life-support systems have shut
down completely and water is obtained from the Sine Ahad river
and food from the Goblin fields and fish that live in the river.
Most of the city's goods and weapons come from raids on other
cities or trading parties. The population of Crollheap is estimated
at between 30,000 and 90,000 souls, varying depending on the amounts
of food and raids.
<P>
<B>Esboran </B>- Esboran, the duergar and derro call this city
home, with it's labyrinthine tunnels and underground buildings.
Only the city walls and the stone citadel rise above the rock
ridge upon which the city is built. The city trades iron and gems
with Draboran and through it with the rest of the dungeon. Most
of Esboran's weapons come from Draboran. Esboran often raids the
other cities, especially Crollheap and Sai-Sigil. Esboran's food
comes from numerous fungus and yeast farms deep in it's bowels,
however water is quite scarce, all of it coming from a single
underground streamlet, so water is very rare and limits the size
of Esboran. No slaves who have escaped Esboran have ever told
of the horrors they had seen - not least because most were missing
their tongues. Esboran holds around 20,000 evil dwarves.
<P>
<B>Sai-Sigil </B>- This city was once the largest and most powerful
city in the cavern (besides the pain maze), but now it is a reeking
collapsing shell of decaying buildings and rubble. Looters, bandits,
monsters, undead, all manner of outcasts and fell beings make
Sai-Sigil their home, and the raiders of Sai-Sigil often raid
the other cities. Sai-Sigil is contested by the other cities and
it's own inhabitants and is in a perpetual war state. Criminals
from the other cities are often sentenced to serve in the war
bands that fight in Sai-Sigil. Amazingly Sai-Sigil's life-support
systems are completely intact, so food and water can easily be
obtained from deep yeast caverns and automated wells. This makes
Sai-Sigil and even more tempting target to the other cities. Sai-Sigil
is inhabited by around 15,000 permanent residents (non-monster),
maybe thrice that number in undead and innumerable monsters.
<P>
<B>Kua-Makiki </B>- This city was once built on a huge bridge
spanning the South river, but that bridge has since collapsed,
sinking much of the city into the murky water. Kua-Makiki is inhabited
by Kua-toa, Crabmen and other even more vile underwater creatures.
Kua-Makiki gets it's food from Faln-Durham lake as well as the
drow slaves (slaves=food) and raids on other river-shore cities,
where frequent raids are organised. Kua-Makiki's life support
systems are all non functioning, but the Kua-toa and crabmen get
both food and water from the other cities, and Kua-Makiki is one
of the best defended and most thriving cities around. It holds
around 40,000 souls.
<P>
<B>Draboran </B>- the Drow city of Draboran is feared for it's
terrible torture chambers and even more terrible Drow. Draboran
is rulled by powerful houses, who vie for power amongst themselves
and with the other cities. The Drow often raid across Raiderwood
into the Fields of Freedom for slaves for their own fields. Draboran
is a rather bustling city and traders from all over the dungeon
come to Draboran to trade their goods and make money, however
whatever the Drow cannot trade for they raid from the other cities.
Draboran has no fungus or yeast farms, however deep wells leading
far below Draboran provide all the water the city needs and it
is filled with innumerable fountains and pools. As many as 20,000
Drow live here and possibly four times as many slaves.
<P>
<B>Myrmarra </B>- the city of Myrmarra has over the centuries
changed it's appearance under the strong guidance of it's queens.
The city is shaped like numerous stone pillars rising into the
sky, the highest reaching almost 300 feet (90 metres). The city
is filled with the Myrmidons and Thri-kreen. The society is orderly
and extremely hierarchial, with the queen ruling over several
vice-queens who rule different parts of the city. The Myrmidons
are the workers of the city and work the fields, the fungus farms
and the quarries deep within the cites. The Thri-kreen, however,
are the city's warriors and besides defending the city often raid
into other regions for food or goods. Myrmarra holds almost 50,000
insect-like residents.
<P>
<B>Khaz-Muar </B>- the dwarven citadel of Khaz-Muar is built entirely
within a large granite hill down which runs the Great Stair which
leads into the cavern from the rest of the dungeon to the north.
Khaz-Muar is a huge and closed society of dwarves and gnomes and
gets it's food from farms in deep caverns far below it and water
from the Dwarf river which springs from the Hammering Fountain
in the centre of the city. It is well known that on occasions
parties of dwarves and gnomes have gone into the pain maze with
the intent of finding new lands to create new dwarven colonies.
It is unknown if any have succeeded. Khaz-Muar is believed to
trade it's gold and gems with other cites further north in the
dungeon. Around 20,000 to 30,000 (guestimates) dwarves and gnomes
live in Khaz-Muar, and guard the North tunnel.
<P>
<B>Crac-Titan </B>- This huge city is build on Crac island in
the middle of North river. Crac-Titan is ruled by a council of
giants, and this city of ogres, bugbears and other large creatures
is a constant threat to the rest of the cavern. Fortunately it
is often split into factions, but even it's raid are terrifying,
often severely depopulating Izund or Crollheap in their search
for slaves. Some 200 giants are known to live in Crac-Titan and
as many as 10,000 ogres and other large humanoids also make their
home there. The smaller slaves mostly work the Goblin Fields and
are used as cannon fodder. The number of slaves swings between
as many as 30,000 and as few as 5,000 (when the number of slaves
falls it's a sure sign of the beginning of a new raiding season).
<P>
<B>Izund </B>- perhaps the fairest city in the dungeon, Izund
is peopled primarily by the surface races and it's main protection
are it's powerful mages and strong soldiers. Numerous elves, hill
dwarves, gnomes, humans, halflings and others make their home
here, and Izund is a major trader with Myrmarra as well as the
rest of the dungeon. Izund is protected by a high, strong wall
and it's powerful mages. The Fields of Freedom are mostly worked
by the Izundians. Izund is ruled by the Council of Races, and
for many years this council has been searching for a way to get
Izund out of the dungeon. Izund gets it's food from it's fields
and water from the North river and deep wells. A few fungus farms
are also kept by the dwarves (from the fungus they make dwarf
bread - i.e. bricks). Izund is quite famous for it's large library
and quite a few turncoat Drow also live there. Izund holds somewhere
around 35,000 souls, in the following proportions: humans(40%),
elves(25%), halflings(10%), gnomes(10%), dwarves(5%), other(10%).
