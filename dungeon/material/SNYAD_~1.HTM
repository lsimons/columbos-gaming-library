<h1><strong>Snyad Surprise</strong></h1>
<h3 align="center"><em>by Philip B. Copp III</em> </h3>

Philip writes: <em>"I developed </em>Snyad Surprise <em>after an adventure where my PCs had encountered a
group of the little guys.  The PCs tried, unsuccessfully, to coax the gremlins from their home. 
Eventually, the PCs gave up; the stolen goods didn't amount to much anyway.  But, this got me
to wondering: 'what if the PCs went in after the snyads?'; and thus, this adventure was born."
"On a side note: If you are to your players as Mr. Merciful and you hear the question: 'You
wouldn't really kill us, would you?'  Just smile wickedly a say: ' There's a first time for
everything.'  Let them ponder </em>that,<em> as you set the timer."</em>

<p>"Snyad Surprise" is an AD&amp;D adventure for 3-6 players of  levels' 1-3 (about 10 total levels). The
adventure is generic enough to fit almost any dungeon, while not affecting the overall plot of the
dungeon. It can be used as an extended encounter or simply as a break from typical adventuring. 
<h4><strong>Adventure Background</strong> </h4>
While crawling through the dungeon the PCs surprise a group of wandering monsters. After a
quick skirmish, the PCs are victorious. As the last monster lays dying, he hands the PCs a vial of
liquid. With his dying breath, he gives the PCs this cryptic omen, "There will come a time when
you must use this to recover what will be lost to the darkness." 
<h4><strong>For the Dungeon Master</strong> </h4>
The vial actually contains a variant of the DMG's potion of diminution. One use will shrink the
imbiber to two feet in height for about 10 rounds (depending on the speed of your players). The
vial contains enough uses for each PC to use it once. While shrunk all numbers relating to size
(movement, weapon damage, weight, missile (but not magic) ranges, etc.) are shrunk accordingly
(all results are rounded up). For example a six-foot, 210 pound human wielding a quarterstaff and
a short bow, becomes a two-foot, 70 pound human who can hit with the staff or shoot a flight
arrow up to 50 yards for 1d2 points of damage. 
<h4><strong>What will be lost . . . </strong> </h4>
This encounter occurs in a hallway(<strong>A</strong>) that is about ten feet wide as the PCs travel along it they
suddenly feel a tugging at their belts as if some pickpocket were plying its trade upon them. The
little thieves are in fact a family of snyads that live below this passage. 

<p><strong>Snyads (8):</strong> INT low; AL TN; AC -4; MV 21; HD 1-1 hp 6, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2; THAC0 20; #AT nil;
Dmg nil; SA steal; SD tantrum; SZ T; ML 8; XP 65; MM/174-5 (Gremlin). 

<p>The snyads will each try to carry off: up to 20 gems, two small items, or one medium item (up to
two pounds). The items stolen should be important enough to make the PCs want to go after
them. If the PCs decide to let the snyads keep the items, the adventure ends here.

<p><font color="#0000ff">Continuing down the passage, you suddenly feel a slight tug at your belt.  Looking down to see
what it was, shows several leathery skinned creatures disappearing through what appears to be a
solid stone wall.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the PCs decide to check their equipment (and you can be sure they will), they will notice the
missing items.  You should also make special notice of the vial they received earlier.

<p>Closer inspection of the wall will reveal a tiny secret door (the one in the upper left), that can only
be entered by drinking the potion of diminution.  Should the PCs not come up with this idea on
their own; you should hint this to them.  The PCs should realize once they drink the potion that
this is not a normal potion of diminution.  You should also tell them that, should the potion's
duration end while they are inside the snyads' tunnel they will be probably be crushed to death.

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As soon as the PCs drink the potion you should start timing them (preferably with an
audible timer; a kitchen timer is excellent for this purpose).  Remember.  The PCs are racing time
here; death should be a very real threat to them (only you know that the alarm is not going to go
off while they are inside).  

<p>Once you've got the timer ticking, and the PC's are ready to go, read the following description to
them:

<p><font color="#0000ff">You go through the door onto a stairway.  You realize that these tiny beings must have
infravision; because the only light provided is that of your guttering torches.  As you walk down
the stairs the sound of bones crunching beneath your boots mingles eerily with the sound of
crackling pitch.  After a short while, you emerge from the stairs and travel down a passage littered
with refuse and tattered bits of clothing.  After traveling a short distance, you come to side
passage on your left; ahead you see another set of stairs leading up into the darkness. </font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>1. Kretzit's Room</strong></h4>
Kretzit is the eldest son in this family and, therefore, has a small personal treasure.  If the PCs
examine the goblin skull in the corner, they will discover 7 cp and a small multicolored gem
worth one sp.

<p><font color="#0000ff">Amid the bones of small mammals, probably rats, you see a small pallet made of old clothes so
old and moldy that they could possibly be worn without falling off.  The only other ornament in
this room is a skull that once belonged to a small humanoid.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>2. Sobraya's Room</strong></h4>
Sobraya is the second child in this family.  She possesses above average intelligence for a snyad
(INT 9)  and has learned to cast the spell <em>magic missile</em>.  She has in her possession a <em>Wand of
Fireworks </em>(new item; see description in room 9); which she will use in combat.  In her room is a
large pottery bowl containing her pet fish (a normal bioluminescent cave fish; cannot attack the
PCs).

<p><font color="#0000ff">There is a certain neatness about this room that is quite unlike the rest of the rooms you've seen
so far.  It's as if the owner of this room possessed the mental capacity to keep some semblance of
order to its things.  The bed is made with a small patchwork coverlet that contains needlepoint far
too precise for any human hand.  A small glow comes from a large clay bowl in the corner of the
room.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>3. Vargt's Room</strong></h4>
Vargt is the second son of this union and is jealous of his brother's position in the household. 
He constantly strives to be better than his brother and, therefore, possesses the finest clothing
available in the house.  If the PCs examine the shirts, they will find a small blue gem worth one
sp (stolen from Kretzit; who knows his brother has it).

<p><font color="#0000ff">Aside from the pallet of rags in the room, and the assortment of bones that seems to appear
everywhere, the only items of interest here are the shirts hanging from a small rib-cage wedged
into a crack in the wall.  Compared to the rest of the clothing you've seen in this place, these
shirts could be worn by nobles.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>4. Grunz's Room</strong></h4>
Grunz is the forth child in this family of eight.  He has a small (edible) mushroom farm growing
in a fluted vase at the foot of his bed.

<p><font color="#0000ff">A small bed made of bone and cloth fills the far side of this room.  At its foot you see a large vase
containing several mushrooms which look to be edible.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>5. Tragor's Room</strong></h4>
Being the second youngest, Tragor hasn't developed much ambition yet.  He does, however, like
to collect small pebbles; and has quite a collection of them strewn around his room.  None of the
pebbles is very valuable; but any PC who has worked with ores (miners, blacksmiths, metal
smiths, etc.) will recognize the shiny, steel-gray pebbles as hematite (the major source of iron).

<p><font color="#0000ff">This room has dozens of small pebbles strewn among the bones and rags that make up the bed of
its small inhabitant.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>6. Barixa's Room</strong></h4>
The youngest child, Barixa, has several toys made of bone in her room.  Among them are: a
necklace of beads, a small whistle, a rat's skull, and a small drum made of a hide stretched over a
ring of bones.

<p><font color="#0000ff">Several toys lying around this room suggest that it is the bedroom of the youngest inhabitant of
this lair.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>7. Novar and Razi's Room</strong></h4>
The master bedroom contains the most bone furniture of all the rooms; including a bone chest,
secreted away beneath the bed, that contains six 50 gp gems and a dagger with a 100-gp amethyst
in its pommel (250 gp).

<p><font color="#0000ff">The bed in this room is twice the size of the other beds; made of solid bone, like the wardrobe
and end table also in this room, this monstrosity could hold a human child.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>8. The Garden</strong></h4>
This room is the snyads' source of sustenance.  All around the room grow many varieties of
fungi (some of which are luminescent and make the mist seem to glow as it disperses their light)
and there is a small pool which contains drinkable water and from which small fish can be
caught.

<p>Read the following description to the PCs as they enter the room:

<p><font color="#0000ff">A cold, glowing mist encircles you like a shroud when you enter this room and the smell of decay
permeates the air.  The sound of running water is interrupted at times by the scurrying of small
creatures in the distance.  The overall decadence of this room seems to suggest a greater life,
however; or rather, a greater <em>un</em>life.</font>

<p>There isn't really any undead in this room; the description was meant to put the PCs back on
their toes.  There are, however, two pit traps which were made to catch the "small, scurrying
creatures"; they will also catch any PCs walking over them.  Any PC falling into them (save vs.
paralysis to keep from falling) will take 1d3 points of damage.  (The traps also have a 25% chance
of containing 1d3 rats, 1d2 hairy spiders, or 1d2 centipedes (33% chance of each) which will
attack any PCs falling upon them).

<p>There are also two holes in the ceiling, leading to area <strong>B</strong>, that any PC walking beneath them will
be snatched up through by the two hobgoblins above.  Any PC snatched has a 25% chance of
having each arm pinned (roll once for each arm).  The hobgoblins will bite the PC (1d6 damage)
unless otherwise distracted (i.e., attacked) in which case they will drop the PC (1d6 points of
damage from the fall) and will leave the PCs alone from then on.  (They are looking for an easy
lunch; not something that bites back).

<p>Should any PCs get caught, read or paraphrase the following:

<p><font color="#0000ff">As you wind your way around the fungi growing upon this rooms floor, you are suddenly
grasped by a pair of giant hands and lifted in the darkness above.  Only when you smell the
nauseating scent of dead rats and spiders do you realize that those strange white stalactites are
teeth.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>9.  The Main Hall</strong></h4>
This chamber is where the snyads will be found most of the time.  When the PCs arrive, the
snyads will be friendly but will wait to see the PCs reaction first (treat as cautious reaction).  If the
PCs ask, or even demand, to have their things returned to them; the snyads will comply. (From
the snyads' point of view, the PCs must be powerful beings indeed if they can change their size
and come into their home).  Should the PCs decide to kill first and ask questions later the snyads
will defend themselves to the best of their ability.

<p>It should be noted that the snyads are intelligent; and will use magical items stolen from the PCs.

<p><strong>Snyads (8):</strong> INT low; AL TN; AC -2 (they no longer have a size bonus); MV 21; HD 1-1 hp 6, 5,
4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1; THAC0 20; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon (pixie sword; damage as dagger); SA steal;
SD tantrum; SZ T; ML 10; XP 65; MM/174-5 (Gremlin).

<p>Should the PCs be looking for a simple encounter, they are in for a surprise.  As mentioned
before, Sobraya has the abilities of a first level mage (and those of a first level thief).

<p><strong>Sobraya Sarexan, sf M1/T1:</strong> AC -4 (-2 without size bonuses); M1/T1;  MV 21; hp 4; THAC0
20; #AT 1; Dmg 1d4 (pixie sword); SA backstab, spells, thief skills; SD tantrum, speed, spells; SZ
T (2' 2" tall); ML average (10); AL N; XP 270.

<p>Notes: SASobraya has her race's ability to steal during combat; and can do so with 80%
accuracy.

<p>S 8, D 21, C 7, I 15, W 8, Ch 6.

<p><em>Personality:</em> sympathetic, curious, extemporaneous.

<p><em>Special Equipment: </em>pixie sword, wand of fireworks.

<p><em>Thief Abilities: </em>PP 80; OL 40; F/RT 25; MS 30; HS 25; DN 20; CW 60; RL 10.

<p><em>Spells (1): </em>1st<em>magic missile.</em>

<p>The <em>wand of fireworks </em>is a unique magical item described below.  Sobraya will use it as often as
she can.

<p align="center"><strong>Wand of Fireworks</strong>

<p><strong>XP Value: </strong>4,000 <strong>                                                                                                      GP Value:</strong> 20,000

<p align="center">New Item

<p>The wand of fireworks will create 1d6 whistling balls of fire (each ball uses one charge) per round
of use.  Each ball has a 25% (50% in closed environments) chance (non-cumulative) of striking a
random target within a 150-foot radius; exploding for 1d4 points of fire damage and igniting
flammable substances.  Any balls that do not hit a target, explode in the air causing a shower of
beautiful sparks and an occasional (25%) <strong>BOOM</strong>.  The wand may be recharged.

<p>Read or paraphrase the following to the PCs upon entering this room:

<p><font color="#0000ff">The high-pitched chattering you heard while approaching this chamber stops upon your entry. 
The wrestling match going on between two of the lair's inhabitants ceases in mid-tumble.  All
eyes turn to you and you receive your first good look at these elusive creatures.  They have
leathery, brown skin and their faces are bat-like.  Each sports a full head of hair ranging from
dirty-blond, through brown, to raven-black.  It seems that the males outnumber the females five
to three in this group.  Before you can speak, the younger of the adult females addresses you in a
common so fast that the words seem to blur together.</font>

<p><font color="#0000ff">"You've come seeking the items we have borrowed from you, no doubt.  Do not worry.  They
will be returned to you, if you promise to leave our home without hurting anything, or anyone. 
Do we have a deal?"</font>

<p>If the PCs agree, there is a small argument in the high-pitched chittering heard before.  When it
boils down, the oldest male reluctantly stands up and goes to the back of the throne of bone he
was sitting upon.  (Other than this, there are seven other bone chairs arrayed about the small fire-pit in the middle of the room).  There is a small click and a section of wall to the PCs' right slides
inward.

<p>If any of the PCs try to enter the secret room, the female (Sobraya) will stop them telling them of
the large rat housed in the room; by the time this has happened, the other snyads will have
returned with the PCs' items and the door will be closed.

<p>After the PCs have their equipment back Sobraya will speak again:

<p><font color="#0000ff">After a thorough equipment check, which reveals <em>all</em> of your original equipment, the petite female
addresses you again.</font>

<p><font color="#0000ff">"My name is Sobraya Sarexan and I will accompany you to make sure that you keep your end of
the bargain."</font>

<p>Sobraya will not accept "no" for an answer; and will accompany the PCs whether they wish it, or
not.  If the PCs should try to stop her physically, she will remain until the PCs are out of sight. 
Then, she will follow unseen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>10. The Treasury</strong></h4>
This room contains the PCs' remaining equipment; as well as a small cache containing 100 pp,
ten 50 gp gems, and a <em>potion of extra-healing.</em>  This treasure is guarded, however, as the room is
also the home of an osquip.

<p><strong>Ozzy (Osquip): </strong>INT animal; AL N; AC 7; MV 12, Br &#189;; HD 3+1, hp 19; THAC0 16; #AT 1;
Dmg 2d6; SA nil; SD nil; SM S; ML 7; MM/300 (Rat).

<p>Should the PCs kill the snyads or enter this room by force give them the following description:

<p><font color="#0000ff">The smell of sour animal sweat assaults your nose as you enter this room.  Gazing around you
see your things amid the sparkle of coins and the bleached white of bones.  After a moment, you
find the source of this room's horrid stench.  Sitting atop a pile of coins and gems, is the largest
rat you have ever seen.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><strong>To the darkness.</strong></h4>
Now, as the PCs affect their escape, it is time for the alarm to go off.  Read the following
description to the players as it does:

<p><font color="#0000ff">Suddenly, the ceiling is not as high as it was and you begin to run.  The walls brush your
shoulders and you are forced to crawl on all fours.  The ceiling eventually forces you to slither
like snakes.  The crush of the walls continues.  The last thing you see before darkness shrouds
your vision is the flickering light of torches.</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><em></em><strong>Concluding the Adventure</strong><em></em></h4>
Take a break now to allow the effect to sink in.  Get a drink of water or go to the bathroom; but
let the PCs think for about five minutes.  Continue the adventure after you return.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The PCs are awakened about fifteen minutes later by Sobraya.  They are back in the hallway that
the original encounter occurred in.  Aside from a few scrapes and some bone splinters, they are
unharmed.

<p><font color="#0000ff">After what seems an eternity, a voice calls to you in the darkness:</font>

<p><font color="#0000ff">"Awaken, dear heroes of legend; you cannot die now.  Wake up."</font>

<p><font color="#0000ff">The light slowly returns, and your vision clears to reveal the face of Sobraya.</font>

<p><font color="#0000ff">"Wake up.  Wake up.  You nearly scared me to death in there.  I was just walking along and
suddenly you started to return to normal size.  Whatever magic you used to go in there must have
failed while you were coming out.  Are you all right?"</font>

<p>After the PCs assure her that they are ok, she will request to join the party.  She could be quite a
useful companion to the PCs; should they allow it.  Her small size allows her to squeeze into
openings much too small for humans.  Also, her ability to steal things is unmatched by any other
thief of her level.

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although I used the proper rules to generate Sobraya, she should <em>only</em> be used as an
NPC; there are just too many ways to abuse a first level character with a base movement rate of
21 and a natural AC of -4.
