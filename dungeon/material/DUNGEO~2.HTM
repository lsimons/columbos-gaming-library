<H1>Introduction</H1>

<HR>

<P>
Submissions for the project seem to take a while. Thus, I've decided
to just start on my own part. Below is a draft version of my submissions.
Any comments are welcome; send them to columbo@simons.demon.nl.
<H4>
<CENTER>
What's in Here?
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
Basically, the first load of material I'm submitting to the ADND.Net.Dungeon.Project.
That includes the general history for the dungeon, as well as
general information. Next to this, there are draft ideas for my
own dungeon section, which I will write together with Philly.
<P>
The history and general dungeon notes can be considered an accepted
part of this project, though they are subject to modification.
For the dungeon section, I ask for any and all suggestions that
would in any way help to improve its design.
<H4>
<CENTER>
Who is Dr. Columbo?
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
Dr. Chris Columbo of DragonMountain is one of the most well-known
sages of the adnd universe. He has traveled many worlds of existence,
and has written detailed and reliable journals. These journals
are valued by adventurers everywhere.
<P>
Dr. Columbo has spent a long time in the dungeon we're talking
about, and is one of the few that have come back. I have taken
the most important information from his journal about this demiplane:<I>
&quot;Columbo's Journals: Deeper than the Abyss</I>&quot;. However,
I cannot guarantee that everything below is undoubtedly true,
since no other records of the dungeon exist, or at least these
cannot be relied on.
<H4>
<CENTER>
Who are you to decide all this?
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
Well, I'm Leo Simons, the project coordinator. I have given everyone
ample time and opportunity to be more involved in the creation
of a general background and history. I have submitted a draft
of this quite a few days ago, and there weren't many responses.
<H4>
<CENTER>
Will the rest of the dungeon be like this document as well?
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
I have no idea. However, I expect to see more concrete material,
like room, NPC and trap description, and less vague material&#133;at
least that's what I hope to see.

<H1>Known History</H1>
<HR>

<H2>Creation</H2>

<P>
The dungeon was created many eons ago, before most worlds started
using a calendar. Civilized human life did not exist on the planet
Terra when it was created, to give an indication.<BR>
Today, very little of this time is known. Information about the
dungeon is vague, and the information about other worlds in this
time is even less. It seems that there were several races of ancient
creatures, some evil, some good. All of them had a great understanding
of both technology and magic.<BR>
One of these races built the dungeon. About their name or appearance,
we can only speculate. They will be referred to as &quot;The Founders.&quot;<BR>
What is known about this creatures is only a little, a tiny little
bit. And most of this is speculation, not fact. See the sidebar
on this page for a description of their culture and appearance.
<P>
The founders were a peaceful race, doing their best to avoid interference
with other, more primitive cultures. When they encountered the
race I call &quot;the Destroyers&quot;, problems arose quickly.
The Destroyers had technology and magic that at least matched
that of the Founders in power, though perhaps not in refinement.
They enslaved all races and planets they encountered. Naturally,
the Founders tried to stop them from doing this.
<P>
For several generations, these races fought a bitter war, a war
that the Founders were slowly loosing. In the end, they were forced
to leave their colonies and go to live in their last safe haven:
the dungeon.
<BR>
The dungeon was made of various materials from various planets
and planes, and brought to life with an unknown way. It lived
in harmony with the Founders, feeding in some way on the energy
that all life houses, the energy known as psionics. In return,
it supplied the Founders with fresh air and a place to live.
<BR>
In order to evacuate the few survivors in the old colonies of
the Founders ruled, the dungeon was connected via gates and other
means to a whole range of worlds, even to several of the outer
planes.
<P>
These gates were constructed to allow Founders to travel freely
from and to any place, with the dungeon as a center for the transport
network. In the end, the entire civilization was to live inside
the demi-plane. Other creatures were unable to use them, unless
the Founders took them with them. The gates were made to specifically
prevent one of the Destroyers to come through.
<P>
The Founder plan worked very well, and soon, all but a few Founders
withdrew from the outer world, preferring to live in their beautiful
underground city. The dungeon was thought the way of magic, and
given the ability to expand by teleporting material in from other
worlds. Everything seemed to be in the Founder's advantage.

<P>
<B>The Founders</B>

<P>
The Founders weren't humanoid in appearance at all. Instead, they
closely resembled the elephants of today. Their build was much
more fragile, and they were only as tall as a human. These creatures
had tusks that were split up several times, to form appendices
which they could use to manipulate items just like humans.
<P>
These elephant-creatures lived in an advanced society. Technology
was more advanced than ors today, but the combination of technology
and magic took their society to a higher level. Each and every
Founder was able to use certain magics, and had an intellect that
surpasses ours even as a child.
<P>
The Founders generally lived very peacefully, taking care not
to disturb the lives of those on the planets they visited. They
colonized many planets, but erased almost all traces of their
existence wherever they went. This is why it is so hard to learn
about them&#133;which might be the best in the end.
<P>
Facts about the Founders are hard to give, but evidence exists
that they had visited and charted most of the planes and crystal
spheres in the multiverse.
<P>
<B>The Destroyers</B>
<P>
The information about the race that destroyed the Founders and
their civilization is even more vague. They were are race of brutal
warriors, who used crude weapons and magics to conquer other worlds
and enslave other races.
<H2>Destruction</H2>

<P>
A good and civilized society the Founders had, capable of giving
any individual what he desired. Yet the Founders were no different
from humans in that some of them sought for power. This caused
the downfall of the Founder Race.
<P>
The extinction of the Founder Race was the guilt of only one of
their own, who betrayed his race for the power promised by the
Destroyers. He misled the dungeon into allowing the Destroyers
to enter. In a quick, bloody battle, every Founder was killed.
<P>
The dungeon went mad. It set up traps and other obstacles, which
killed the Destroyers to the last creature.
<BR>
Then, the dungeon was empty, totally devoid of any life. This
meant the dungeon would die soon, if no new creatures would populate
it.
<BR>
The hunger for psionic energy and the loss of its creators drove
the dungeon beyond the hope for any recovery.
<BR>
At this point, I think I need to clarify something about the dungeon's
brain. This was not a single mass, as with most creatures, but
rather a network of largely independent sections.
<P>
The mental illness of the dungeon resulted in each of these sections
gaining a separate consciousness and personality. Some of them
were totally rational, highly intelligent and of good alignment.
Most were insane and had only evil intentions. Some of the brains
collapsed into complete insanity.
<H2>Expansion</H2>

<P>
The original city the Founders built was able to house only a
couple thousand of their kind. Of this original city, almost nothing
remains. With the overall control of the dungeon gone, and the
Founders all killed, the city truly became a dungeon. Most of
the individual brains dumped the empty city parts, because this
city reminded them of the Founders, and the part they had played
in their destruction.
<P>
Instead, the gate abilities the dungeon brains had were used to
gate in large chunks of dungeon from other worlds, sometimes complete
societies, complete with the creatures that had built them. Soon
it size was doubled, tripled, and quadrupled. Then, each brain
had enough minds under control to sustain itself easily.
<P>
The expansion slowed down, until the removal and addition of areas
was mostly in balance. Though new areas appear and old ones dissolve,
the total size of the dungeon remains approximately the same.
We can only make guesses about its total size, but it is larger
than any other known dungeon.
<H1>Physics</H1>

<HR>

<H2>General</H2>

<P>
The Demiplane is in most aspects like other worlds. In fact, it
sometimes takes those unfortunate souls that enter the dungeon
weeks to find out where they have stranded. When no information
is given, the Demiplane works just like a standard world. Gravity
is normal, water flows down, priestly and wizardly magic function&#133;you
get the picture.
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Only Law: The Law of Unpredictability
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Though most parts of the Demiplane share the same characteristics,
some of them are wildly different from others. This can take many
shapes. Some areas are magic-dead, whilst others have no gravity,
no light, and hydrogen instead of normal air. This law goes above
any of the others, be they below or somewhere else.
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Law of Relative Gravity
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Though almost the whole dungeon has a normal gravity field, this
gravity field isn't always in the same direction. On a planet,
gravity is caused by the planet's size. In this Demiplane, gravity
is artificial. So it is possible to walk through a corridor, and
then suddenly fall to the roof, with the roof being the floor
from that moment on.
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Law of Air
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Most areas of the Demiplane receive air from an unknown source.
Some say there is a magical ventilation system, whereas others
see this as just one of the elemental laws; the atmosphere just
doesn't run out of air.
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Law of Endlessness
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
The demiplane has no north, south, west or east, no top or bottom.
In fact, the position of the different sections to one another
cannot be determined when they are not actually linked together.
<H2>Of Magic and the Mind</H2>

<P>
Most magic spells function normally within the dungeon; priests
can pray for spells as normal, wizards have no limitations on
memorization, and psionics can be used.
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Law of Superiority
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
All magic can basically function, from levels 1 to 10. However,
within the Demiplane, the power of all magic spells cast by the
dungeon or the Founders is always superior. This means that these
spells cannot be dispelled, altered or controlled in any way;
even magic resistance is useless against these spells. No <I>dispel
magic</I>, <I>wish</I>, or any other spell can break them.
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Law of Ensnarement
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Any teleportation spells function normally within the Demiplane,
as long as they are not used to teleport <U>out</U> of the dungeon.
When they are used in such a way, the spells effects are altered,
and the subjects of the spell are teleported into a different
part of the dungeon&#133;quite often into solid rock!
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Law of Restriction
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
While memorized 10th level spells can be cast, it is not possible
to regain spells while in the dungeon. Any priest or wizard who
tries to do so loses his spell slot/points for that day.
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Law of Psionic Control
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
The dungeon brains have immense psionic strength. They drain psionic
energy from all creatures. This draining cannot be resisted, even
by the most powerful psionicists. The rate of draining equals
around 0.5 PSP per hour, though it can be as much as 4 per hour
in some areas, and non-existent in others.
<H3>
<CENTER>
The Law of Psionic Resistance
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
The psionic presence of the dungeon is visible everywhere. As
a result, many psionic powers cannot be used, in particular those
of the clairsentient and telepathic disciplines. Any spell that
has something to do with mindreading or sensing psionic energy
or activity does not function. When a psionicist attempts to use
such a power, he blacks out for 1d10 rounds.
