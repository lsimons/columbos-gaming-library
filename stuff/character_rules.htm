<P>
To use the system below, you should be familiar with Players'
Option: Skills and Powers rules. You do not need to own the book,
you just have to know how the thing works.
<P>
The idea is as follows: instead of using classes, which restrict
the abilities a player can have, players now have total freedom
when creating their character. The rules allow for one to advance
in Thac0 like a warrior and in hit points like a wizard (though
that won't happen too often.)
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414002325">Step By Step</A></H3>

<OL>
<LI>Determine what kind of character you wish to play. Picture
what he looks like, his behaviour, general character, and his
race.
<LI>Use what ever method you like to generate his 6 (12) subability
scores. I recommend top give the players 130-160 ability points,
which they can freely divide among their sub-scores. Exceptional
strength can be purchased for 1 point per category (by any character
except halflings). Players may opt to save ability points. One
ability point is then converted to 2 character points.
<LI>Now, choose a race, and pick the abilities that are unique
to this race as per the standard players' option rules (it is
still not possible for an elf to have mining skills).
<LI>Pick the abilities you want, working through all the options
from the first to the last. If you read further, this means you
start with class abilities, then kit abilities, and then proficiencies.
<LI>Now, let your DM check if everything is right. As a DM, you
are advised to make sure that raw combat power between the characters
is about evenly matched. Also, rule out anything that doesn't
fit to your world or your personal style. (Players, don't complain
about this, you have choice enough already.)
<LI>Write up your Character Sheet.
<LI>Equip your character.
<LI>Write down some notes about history and behaviour of you character.
<LI>Done!
</OL>

<P>
<B>DMs Note: </B>the rules are designed so that you can use them
next to existing rules. For example, a player who only knows First
Quest rules can still use these rules, and all other systems can
be used together as well. However, there will be more diversity
in characters if you'll only use these rules.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414002326">Introduction</A></H3>

<P>
In the standard system, you belong to a class and cannot change
this class to another one. It is also not possible to combine
the classes freely. While you can play a fighter/mage, this costs
a lot: you require double xp and cannot cast spells while in armor.
Wouldn't it be better if you could play a character who is a good
fighter, but not as good as a real one, and you would be able
to use some spells, but not as good as a real wizard?
<P>
In this new system, the boundaries between the classes are shifted.
You are free to choose any ability you wish. For example, playing
a wizard who gains 1d12 hp per level is now possible. The idea
is still the same: you use CPs to purchase abilities.
<P>
After you have determined your ability scores and race, you are
ready to select all other abilities. While there are no abilities
you cannot select separately, some will be illogical. Try to build
a character in a logical way. Don't try to create a character
that is all-powerful. Keep in style! (for example, it is very
strange for a character to be able to create magical items as
a wizard, while being unable to use them!)
<P>
I'll be creating a character for a generic campaign world (lets
say FR) as an example. It is assumed you have access to all players'
option books.
<P>
<I>The DM has told me that I have 155 points (like all others
I play with) to divide among my subabilities. I cannot play drow,
duergar, half-orcs or half-ogres. All other races are allowed.
In addition, there is no limit to how much character points I
can save from the racial point allowance.</I>
<P>
<I>First, I have to describe my character in a few sentences to
the DM: My character is an eternal wanderer. I cannot stay in
one place for too long, and have trouble finding friends. As such,
I have learned skills that allow me to detail with most dangers
of the road. In a way, I'm much like a bard. I will play a half-elf,
for this description suits a half-elf.</I>
<P>
<I>This will be my scores:</I>
<PRE WIDTH=132>
<I>Stamina: 16</I>            Muscle: 14              

<I>Aim: 13</I>                Balance: 15             

<I>Health: 10</I>             Fitness: 12             

<I>Reason: 13</I>             Knowledge: 10           

<I>Intuition: 15</I>          Willpower: 11           

<I>Leadership: 12</I>         Appearance: 14          


</PRE>

<P>
<I>I spent all the 155 points on the abilities, not saving any.
Of the Half-Elf racial abilities, I only choose infravision, 60'(10
points, leaving 15.)</I>
<P>
At this point, each player gains 100 Character Points, which can
be spent on the following abilities. To these 100 points, add
anything left from the score selection and from the racial abilities.
<P>
Abilities with shaded background are optional; your DM may not
allow all (or any.)
<P>
<I>That means 100+15=115 for me. Lets go shopping.</I>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc408659747">Choosing Primary Abilities</A></H3>

<P>
The first thing you'll have to do is select such basic things
as the number of hit points you gain per level and Thac0.

<P>
If you do not spend any points here, you will receive 1d8 hit
points per level, up to and including level 9. Starting at level
10, you'll only gain 1 hit point per level. Characters always
get hit point bonuses from high constitution.
<UL>
<LI><B>no hit point improvement (+40) </B>This option gives 40
extra points, but the character will not gain extra hit points
when he increases in level. (1d8 hit points at the beginning of
the game, and no more, except from constitution.)
<LI><B>1 hit point per level (+25)</B>  The character gains 1
hit point per level beyond first.
<LI><B>1d4 hit points per level (+15)</B>  The character gains
1d4 hit points up to and including 9th (not 10th) level.

<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002330">Armor Allowed</A></H4>

<P>

to wear any armor at all. He cannot use shields.
<LI><B>armor up to ac 8 (leather armor) (+15)</B>

weapon (limited by size, and optionally, strength), normally.
The penalty for nonproficiency is -2.
<UL>
<LI><B>no weapons allowed (+25)</B>  The character cannot become
proficient with any weapon, though he may still use them. (using
a wizards' nonproficiency penalty of -5).

a piece.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002341">Psionic Abilities</A></H4>

<P>
These abilities can only be chosen if psionics are allowed in
the campaign.
<P>
A character who wishes access to any of these abilities has to
spend 10 points.
<UL>
<LI><B>Attack Specialisation (10):</B>   The psionicist is good
at using psionicist attacks, gaining a +1 bonus on MTHAC0 rolls
vs. Character MACs and doing an extra +2 bonus on the PSP damage.
Also, the Psionicist gains extra psionic attacks faster as normal:
<BR>
Level:   1-6 7-12 13+<BR>
# of attacks:  3/2 2/1 5/2
<LI><B>Bonus PSPs (5):</B>   The psionicist gains an extra PSP
at each level of experience.
<LI><B>Charm Resistance (10):</B>  The Psionicist gains a +2 on
Saving Throws vs. charm-related spells.
<LI><B>Contact (3):</B>    The psionicist can participate in psionic
combat.
<LI><B>Detect Psionics (10):</B>   The psionicist can detect psionic
activity (the expenditure of PSPs) in a path 10 feet wide and
60 feet long. Chance of Success is 10%, plus the psionicists wisdom
score and his level.
<LI><B>Dis/Sci/Dev Progression (30): </B>The Psionicist gains
Disciplines, Sciences and Devotions as normal.
<LI><B>Fast Recovery (10):</B>   The psionicist recovers his PSPs
faster, at a rate of 1/6 of his total per hour.
<LI><B>followers (5/10):</B>   The psionicist gains followers
as described in Skills and Powers. By spending 10 CPs, he gains
these followers at 2nd level.
<LI><B>Improved MTHAC0 (10):</B>  The Psionicist gains a +2 bonus
on his MTHAC0.
<LI><B>MTHAC0 (15):</B>   The Psionicst has the MTHAC0 of a psionicist.
<LI><B>Wild Talent MTHAC0 (10):</B>  The Psionicsit has the MTHAC0
of a wild talent.
<LI><B>Persistent Power (10 +2 per point of maintenance cost):</B>
   The Psionicist may select one Devotion he knows to have a persistent,
permanent duration. He permanently looses the PSPs that this power
costs. By concentrating, the wizard may activate the power and
maintain it for as long as he continues to concentrate. For example,
a persistent All-Round vision would cost 20 CPs and reduce the
psionicist PSP total by 5, permanently.
<LI><B>Point Progression (35):</B>  The Psionicist gains Disciplines,
Sciences and Devotions using the system described here: The psionicist
gets disciplines as normal, and gains a number of points to spent
on his sciences and devotions. A science costs 2 points, a devotion
costs one point. The psionicist starts with 5 points at first
level, and gains 1 &#189; point every level afterwards.<BR>
<I>Masha, a 3rd lvl psionicist, uses this system to purchase her
powers. She chooses Psychometabolism as  a Prime Discipline, and
Psychokinetism as a second Discipline. Now she has 8 (5+3) points
to spent on sciences and disciplines. She could take 4 sciences
 and no devotions, or 1 science and 6 devotions. Or she could
purchase 1 science and 6  devotions, which is what a psionicist
normally has at 3rd level.</I>
<LI><B>Preparation Time reduction (3/5):</B> The initiative phase
of the PCs psionic powers goes up by one phase. For 2 CPs, the
psionicist may accelerate the powers from his primary discipline
only. For 5 CPs, all powers are faster.

<P>
If you only use the new rules, the DM can use any xp table he
likes for the characters (slowing or speeding up level progression.)
<P>
If not, you should use the table below. It penalises the players
for having more choices.

</H3>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002344">About Kits and Proficiencies</A></H4>

<P>
It is assumed that someone of the adventurer class can choose
any proficiency and any kit. Weapon proficiencies cost 3 cp/proficiency,
unless the character can specialise in a weapon. Note that to
be able to use the warrior special attack specialisations and
stuff you need to have the specialisation ability.
<P>
It is assumed players no longer gain CPs to spend on (non)weapon
proficiencies. If you do wish to give your players these CPs,
give them 6 for nonweapon proficiencies, and 6 for weapon proficiencies
as well.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002345">Buying Character Points</A></H4>

<P>
You may wish to 'buy' extra character points. This is possible,
though it means a stiff penalty. You can gain extra CPs by taking
on xp penalties, as shown in the table below.
<P>
Humans may not opt to use this rule. If you completely discard
this rule, demihumans loose the advantage of multi-classing.

<P>
You may have character points left, after you have chosen proficiencies
and stuff. You can 'sell' these points. For this, you gain an
xp bonus.

</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc408659762">Creating New Abilities</A></H4>

<P>
It is easy for DMs to add new abilities. For example, you may
wish to allow (dis)abilities from kits to be chosen as well. (I
don't like kits, so I haven't made the effort.) Simply assign
a character point cost to the ability.
<P>
As a player, you may wish to have an ability that isn't on the
list. Ask your DM!
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002348">Creating New Classes</A></H4>

<P>
You may not wish to use these rules. That's just fine. But you
can still use them to create new classes easy, and more quickly,
too. Simply take a 100 points and buy the abilities. Write these
down and you have a class. If you do create a class this way,
it is best if you use the wizard or ranger xp table, instead of
the one above. The extra xp penalty in this table is there because
freedom of choice should somehow be penalised.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002349">Delayed Ability Acquisition</A></H4>

<P>
As an optional rule, players can reduce the cost of an ability
by choosing to delay it to a higher level. An ability that is
not acquired until 3rd level is 1 point cheaper than the listed
cost, an ability delayed to 5th level is 2 points cheaper, an
ability delayed to 7th level is 3 points cheaper, an ability delayed
to 9th level is 4 points cheaper, and an ability delayed to 11th
level is 5 points cheaper. The minimum cost for an ability is
1 point.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002350">Additional Ability Acquisition</A>
</H4>

<P>
As another optional rule, players can acquire class abilities
as they rise in level, as they can choose proficiencies. For example,
a player can choose to gain the weapon specialisation ability
(10CPs) at 5th level.
<P>
However, characters cannot gain access to ability groups they
previously  did not have access to (if that rule is used). So,
if the player did not choose access to the thieving group at the
beginning, he cannot gain any abilities from that group later.
<P>
The cost fro selecting new abilities becomes more and more as
the player gains levels. At levels 1 to 3, the cost is as normal.
At levels 4-7, players pay 1 CP extra for each ability. At levels
8-9, they pay 2 CPs extra, at levels 10-11 this is 3 CPs, at levels
12-13, this is 4 CPs, at levels 14 and 15, this is 5 CPs. Beyond
15th level, players can no longer pursue abilities in this way.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002351">Multi-classed characters</A></H4>

<P>
Playing a multi-class character is not possible anymore. The rules
above give players a way to create a sort of multi-class character
already.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002352">Dual-classed characters</A></H4>

<P>
The rules for switching classes are not changed for humans. Simply
give him 80 points again, and allow him to select his new abilities.
Treat these as his new class. Note that it is not necessary to
select the primary abilities again, so the points gained are decreased
from 100 to 80.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002353">Abilities from the High-Level Campaign
handbook</A></H4>

<P>
I have not worked out new rules for these abilities. I suggest
you use them as they are there, allowing characters only those
abilities that are appropriate for them.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002354">Abilities from other sources</A></H4>

<P>
If you wish to use other abilities, that means you have to do
some work. Rules for characters from the Dark Sun setting are
downloadable from my DS site.
