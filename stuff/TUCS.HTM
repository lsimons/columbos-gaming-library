<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
This new combat and initiative system was first thought of in
the early summer of 1997. I felt a need for a better combat system
than the original AD&amp;D-system. That system took to long time
to play and I noticed that many players weren't paying too much
attention to the parts of the battle that didn't involve their
own PCs. But still I didn't want to make a totally new system
that changed any other parts of the game. So I sat down with the
intention of making a system that:
<OL>
<LI>Was faster to play than the original AD&amp;D-system.
<LI>Made players more observant during battleplay.
<LI>Made its rules from excisting AD&amp;D rules and terms.
</OL>

<P>

<P>
And so I came up with the TimeUnit combat system. The core idea
was inspired by the computer game &quot;X-Com - Terror from the
Deep&quot;, but I didn't want any rounds in my new system. I wanted
each battle to be an ever ongoing activity, with no pauses.
<HR>

<H2>Statistics</H2>

<P>
Introducing the new parameter into the system - The TimeUnit
<P>
1 TU = approx. 6 seconds
<P>
Just as with original AD&amp;D rules, this is a metavariable,
it does not exist. Things could happen in real-life at the beginning,
at the end, or even between two TUs - but in the game it can't.
You may initially think it is unnecessary to cut initiative and
combat rules into even smaller time-fragments than original rules,
but please read on, try the system a couple of times and see how
it works. It changed our gameplay - maybe it can change yours
too!
<HR>

<H2>Initiative</H2>

<P>
The first thing we're going to do is to get rid of 'rounds'. In
my opinion this term is the weakest part of the original rules
- as soon as some players are finished with their action in the
combat round they wait until the next round, and while they wait,
they start smoking, telling jokes and generally loses interest
of what other players do. Now, smoking and talking is a part of
many RPG-groups, but during combat it should be avoided.
<P>
To get rid of rounds the DM will 'count-the-battle' starting with
TU = 1 and counting upwards. This makes the battle an ongoing
activity, no pauses caused by the term 'round' - there are no
rounds anymore.
<P>
To decide initiative do the following to decide at what TU your
action should occur:
<OL>
<LI>Roll 1d10 initiative
<LI>Add any modifiers
</OL>

<P>

<P>
This number added to the current TU gives the TU at which your
action should happen. A short example will visualize the idea:
<P>
We are at the very beginning of a battle (TU = 0), and Bolog wants
to throw a Magic missile at one of the orcs that are attacking.
His initiative roll is 4, adding the casting time of the spell
gives 5, and adding the spell expense gives a totoal of 8. So
when the DM has counted to TU = 8 Bolog can throw his Magic missile
at the orc. Now, Bolog must also throw his next initiative roll
and decide what to do next. Bolog decides that he wants to hit
another orc with his bare hands. Bolog rolls initiative of 6,
and adding body speed (5) gives  a total of 11, adding this to
the current (8) tells us that Bolog may hit the orc at TU = 19.
Of course, while Bolog tries to do these actions the orc is also
doing something. The orc might hit Bolog within the casting time
of the spell (CT) and interrupt the spell, or punch his short
sword into him - yes, even killing Bolog. The example here works
fine without putting the orcs TUs into the example as well.
<P>
It is also possible for any PC at any time to change his mind
about what he wants to do. He simply makes another initiative
roll and adds any modifiers and adds the total of that to the
current TU.
<HR>

<H2>Combat</H2>

<P>
If you read the intiative section above you should have no problems
understanding how attacking with weapons work in this new system.
But what about Bolog who is an expert with his quaterstaff and
may attack thrice in two rounds? How can we transfer his skill
to the new system? It is simple, use the table below:
<P>
 
<PRE WIDTH=132>
<B>#AT</B>   MAATU     

3/2   6         

  2       5     

 5/2      4     

  3       3     

 7/2      2     

  4       1     

4+    1         


</PRE>

<P>
Looking at the table we find Bologs MAATU to be 6. This is the
TUs that will pass between his first and second attack. (MAATU
= Multiple Attack AddOn TU).
<P>
The current TU = 25. Bolog rolls a 3 on initiative for his multiple-attack,
adding the weapon speed (4) gives a total of 7. So bolog makes
his first-attack at TU = 32, adding the MAATU (6) makes the second-attack
occur at TU = 38.
<HR>

<H2>Spells</H2>

<P>
When casting spells we found it necessary to add a spell expense
of 3. An example will illustrate how this works:
<P>
Bolog want to cast his Magic missile spell at one of the orcs
attacking. His initiative roll is 4, adding the casting time of
the spell (1), and adding the spell expense (3) gives a total
of 8.
<P>
If you want in-depth information on why we added the spell expense
see the Misc. section.
<P>
One major benefit here is when concering spell durations. Use
this table:
<P>
1 round = 10 TUs = 1 minute
<P>
1 turn = 100 TUs = 10 minutes
<P>
If a spell has a duration of 4 rounds and is cast at TU = 37,
it ends at TU = 77, it's that simple.
<P>
If you are changing your mind when casting spell you do not lose
the spell if you change your mind before the casting time is the
current TU. If you are casting a Fireball at TU = 28, and you
decide to change your mind at TU = 24 you do not lose the spell,
but if you decided to change you mind at TU = 25, 26 or 27 you
would lose it, since this TU is within the casting time of the
spell (Fireball has a casting time of 3). This also applies when
spellcasters are interrupted while casting spells.
<HR>

<H2>Misc.</H2>

<P>
You've probably thought of this yourself, after you read the last
part of the spell section. There is no need to keep counting rounds
anymore. Poision onset-times are calculated just as spell durations
(1 minute = 10 TUs), and also people that are 'stunned 1d4 rounds'
are easier than before to handle by the DM. There are probably
hundreds of situations where this benefit of the new system can
be used, but you will have to think of those situations yourself.Notes
<P>
The early edition of the TU-system used proficiency-level as a
parameter for the MAATU table. This was changed, much since we
wanted to incorporate simple rules also for every monster in the
game, and also since it did not take into account the RoF of any
weapons. We changed it so that the MAATU was derived from the
AD&amp;D-term #AT. MAATU derivation from #AT was co-designer Andr&eacute;'s
idea. 
<P>
In the very first playtesting sessions, we did not have any spell
expense at any level.. We soon found out that balance between
spellcasters and non-spellcasters was not maintained. Co-designer
Nils Petter and myself tried out alot of different ways to get
spells just-a-little-bit slower, and in the end it was easier
than we first thought of - consequently the system now has a spell
expense equal to 3 TUs.
<P>
Thanks to Olik from Bergen, Norway, for pointing out that 10 TUs
= 1 minute, and not as in a previous version where 1 minute was
set to 20 TUs.
