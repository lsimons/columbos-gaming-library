<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
This is the third part in a series that gives my view on the art
of Dming. This one describes a way to create a city. In the creation
of this document, I have received help from:
<UL>
<LI>Chris Knudson
<LI>Oliver Ahad
<LI>Admiral
<LI>Erik Arneson
<LI>Gary Wilson
<LI>Staffan Johansson
<LI>Richard Screiber
</UL>

<P>
Of course, I have used ideas from other sources as well, which
I will not try to list here. Note this is the opinion of just
one DM, and it describes only one possible method for making a
city.
<P>
This document is about making a sizable city, one in which PCs
can adventure for a long time. For the creation of simple, less
detailed cities, refer to part I in these series.
<H2>1: Basic Idea</H2>

<P>
Why does your city exist? That is the first, and one of het most
important questions you should ask yourself. The people that live
in the city all need to have some way to make a living.  Here
are some possibilities:
<UL>
<LI>the city is on the coast, a location that is very useful to
traders. Besides this, a main food source can be fish.
<LI>the city is along a riverside (or better, rivermouth), for
the same reasons as above. Also, cities often grew around passable
parts of a river, later building bridges.
<LI>the city is the centre of an agricultural society. Farmers
and tradesmen come and sell their goods in the city.
<LI>the city is built around the King's Castle. The presence of
strong arms, and nobles with money to spend and mouths to be filled
often attracts others.
<LI>the city is built near a very profitable iron, silver or goldmine.
</UL>

<P>
Think about this part, because it will influence all other aspects
of your city. A side note: the placement of your city on the map
directly relates to the answer you provide for the question above.
There is no logic in placing a capital city in the midst of a
desolate mountain reach.
<H2>2: History</H2>

<P>
How did your city come to be? Think about this carefully. Who
founded the city? Why did the city grow to it's current size?
Who have ruled the city? Invaded it? Destroyed it?
<P>
Write up a history on your city. Often, you will think up a suitable
name during this phase in the creation process. You can keep the
history very brief, or you can devote several pages to it.
<H3>
<CENTER>
Architecture
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
One important thing to think of here is the way the city was constructed,
and what happened to it throug the years. At least briefly note
down some things about this. Some things to consider:
<UL>
<LI>Was the city constructed according to a detailed plan? (this
influences what buildings stand where, straightness and with of
roads, etc.)
<LI>What was the purpose of the city? (a trading city looks different
form a mining community)
<LI>What resources were available? (a city in a mountanous area
will feature many stone buildings and cobblestone roads, whereas
a forest city will be made mostly out of wood)
<LI>Who built the city? (Dwarves tend to construct orderly, well-planned,
defendable cities. Elves will build a city filled with trees)
<LI>What happens to waste? (this one is very important. Im most
medieval cities, the people of today would pass out from the terrible
smell, since there weren't any sewers)
</UL>

<P>
Of course there are many more things you will think of. Try to
define the way the society which made the city built there houses,
temples and palaces. Think of Medieval Europe, ancient China,
Egypt, the Aztecs, and so on. Visit your library to learn more
about this.
<H2>3: Mapping</H2>

<P>
There is no easy way to draw a city map. It will stay a lot of
work. There are computer programs that will ease the process,
but these aren't without flaws. None of them. 
<P>
At first, all you need is a rough layout. You don't have to fill
in every detail. Leave plenty white areas, so you can expand freely
when you feel like it. I'm terrible at mapping, but here is a
way to do it:
<UL>
<LI>Start with a rough sketch of the main fortifications and older
citywalls. Add some additional walls.
<LI>Place the markets and squares. Connect via roads.<BR>
<B>Note:</B> most cities developed haphazardly (except Roman fort-cities),
so make the roads wander a bit. More so in the older areas. Streets
tend to be narrow - A major street would be at most 20 feet (@6
meters) most tend towards 10 feet (@ 3 meters) or less for side
streets and alleys. Most streets were unpaved until the Late-Middle
ages. 
<LI>Once you are finished with this sketch expand it onto large
graph paper (3' x 2').
<LI>Draw in small streets, main buildings (guildhalls, palaces,
prisons, etc.)
</UL>

<P>
During het next step, you can draw in the buildings you think
of. If your city is so large its impossible to detail every building
within it, divide your map into section (perhaps 4, or 9, or even
12). Draw a separate map for each of these.
<P>
What I've done with DragonMountain (my base campaign city), is
draw a simple sketch of het entire city. I then did a detailed
map, with all buildings in the city centre and dock area on it.
Within this section, I chose another area. I expanded this again
and drew each building in more precise detail.
<H2>4: Thingies</H2>

<P>
Here's a list of things you might want to write up about your
city:
<UL>
<LI>a view. Write up a detailed description of what you would
see when you approach the city.
<LI>laws.
<LI>details on rulers.
<LI>details on important figures, like mages, tradelords, and
crimelords.
<LI>details on the army and military protection.
<LI>details on celibrations.
<LI>details on the culture of the inhabitants.
<LI>details on trade, like produced goods, taxes, and more.
<LI>the list goes on forever.
</UL>

<H2>5: Description</H2>

<P>
The largest part of the design by far is that of actually describing
the persons and places inside the city. The problem with describing
a city is that you can't describe anything. When you're writing
up a dungeon, you have the option to write a description of everyone
and everything in it. With a city, this is simply unmanageable.
There are hundreds, and often thousands of buildings. There is
no way you could detail all of these in a lifetime. Fortunately,
there are a few shortcuts you can use:
<UL>
<LI><B>Random Building Generation Tables:</B> make up a table
to generate buildings. Decide on a method to determine # of floors,
size, state of the building, use of het building, and any other
things you can think of. Check the Waterdeep boxed set for an
exampel of such a table.
<LI><B>Building Classification System:</B> think up of a way to
classify a building quickly. Check out 'A Thorough Guide to DragonMountain'
by doctor Chris Columbo for an example of such a system (available
on my webpage, www.simons.demon.nl).
<LI><B>Standard Floor Plans:</B> draw several standardised floor
plans (one for shops, one for warehouses, etc.)
</UL>

<P>
Also, there is no need to describe a building in detail. A single
paragraph about its appearance, the inhabitants, and cost of any
services (above or below average) is usually all you need.
<P>
Some of the important things:
<UL>
<LI>guildhalls. The adventurer's guild, armourer's guild, bladesmither's
guild, and so on are all places your players are likely to visit.
<LI>sherrif's office: players often have to deal with local authorities
(either for turning in one of het bad guys, or for being turned
in!).
<LI>inns: every adventurer needs a place to spend het night.
</UL>

<H4>
<CENTER>
What's in a City?
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
Here is a list of shops, other buildings, and people you might
want to detail:
<UL>
<LI>docks, shipyards (if by a waterway)
<LI>armorer, smithy, weaponry, brass and metalworks
<LI>wheelwright, carpenter, furniture, stonecutter, poterrer,
bower/fletcher
<LI>hardware store, fuel(wood, charcoal, oil), stables
<LI>butcher, poultry, fishery, winery, baker(breda, cakes, pasteries)
<LI>market(vegetables, fruit, spices, cheese, grain)
<LI>shops, varia(lotions, dyes, cosmetics, soaps, perfumes, rare
gifts, flowers, carpets, lanterns, mirrors, wax, ropes, pawnshops,
usedgoods)
<LI>tailor, silks, gowns, lingerie, cobbler, jeweler, leatherer,
fur,clothing in general
<LI>varia(medicinal{herbs}, moneychanger, scribe, cartographer,
sage, beauty parlor, barber, bath house arena, theater, gambling
dens, restaurant, taverns,<BR>
festhalls, boarding houses, inns)
<LI>hireling rentals, mercenary companies, merchant companies
<LI>citadel, jail, guard barracks, temples
<LI>outsiders(fishers, hunters, herders, farmers, miners, lumberers)
</UL>

<P>
This should give you more than enough ideas, but note that this
list is by no means exhaustive. When describing these, try to
include an adventure hook whenever possible. You will find these
useful at times.
<H4>
<CENTER>
A Neighbourhood
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
I have foudn it very useful to detail one section of the city
in much greater detail. It works best when you choose an area
with several shops, inns, and perhaps even a wizard home. Detail
the most important shops in large detail, as well as one or two
inns and all major characters in het neighbourhood. Describe their
daily habits, background, relations, and be sure to include loads
and loads of possible adventure hooks.
<P>
Describe the less important buildings briefly, but do note their
outside appearance and inhabitants. Detailing such a neighbourhood
will help you to make the city seem vivid and alive in the eyes
of your players.
<H4>
<CENTER>
Areas of Danger
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
Think of areas where you can put the PCs in some danger. After
all, adventures without the thrill of danger are only half the
fun. Possibilities:
<UL>
<LI>a dungeon located below the city (a really overused one, but
who cares?)
<LI>a graveyeard (for undead horrors and het like)
<LI>a rough district (robberies, assassinations and the like can
be fun&#133;perhaps your players want to come over to the dark
side and compete with the local thief guilds!). Often these areas
are near the docks of a city.
<LI>dangers outside the city.
</UL>

<P>
Of course, the greatest danger comes from the common people. In
a city, you might find a vampire, a werewolf, several evil wizards,
and an evil ruler who secretly destroys anyone that gets in his
way. You may very well choose to stay away from  the typical dungeon
crawl and instead get your players involved in the intricate (and
deadly!) struggle for power and influence between the wealthy
in the city.
<H4>
<CENTER>
Your city should live!
</CENTER>
</H4>

<P>
Where a dungeon can often depend on traps and monsters, what makes
city adventuring fun is interaction. Populate your shops, inns,
taverns, markets and streets with interesting characters. Make
sure of that only 1 in 50 of all barkeepers is the typical over-weighted,
bald and talkative man. Give your players nice descriptions. Act
out your NPCs mannerism. Imitate their voices. This will be the
difference between a good and a bad game.
