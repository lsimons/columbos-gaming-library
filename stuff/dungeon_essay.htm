<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
This is the second part in the essay that gives my view on the
art of dungeon mastering. It deals with the creation of a good
dungeon. There are more tomes like this, some good, some bad.
I've stolen ideas and information from many of them.
<P>
Please note that all this is the opinion of just one DM.

In this essay, you will find guidelines for creating an organised
dungeon, and find many points you should think of when building
it. It gives you a step-by-step guide to building a dungeon. Some
of the things here will look very familiar if you have read part
one of the essay. If you haven't read the other essay, you might
wish to do so. It includes many general notes about consistency,
plot writing, adventure making, and more.

A Defenition
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
A dungeon in the adnd game is just about any complex of linked
chambers, corridors, and halls that is built underground. This
includes mazes, drow cities, cave complexes, and much more.
<H2>1. Purpose</H2>

<P>
Before actually creating the dungeon, consider what effect you
wish to accomplish with it. What purpose will the dungeon serve?
Here are points to consider:
<UL>
<LI><B>Scope:</B> a dungeon that will be used for multiple adventures,
perhaps for an extended campaign, will be very different from
one which will be used once in a sidetrek adventure.
<LI><B>Players: </B>if you're working with unexperienced players,
you will have to make the dungeon 'easier'. Some players are able
to pick up clues about deadtraps and stuff naturally, but other
players will learn this only slowly.
<LI><B>Level: </B>this is an obvious point. A dungeon for high-level
characters is certainly different from one for 1st levels.
<LI><B>Anything Else:</B> think for a minute if there is anything
else you wish to use this dungeon for in gameplay. For example,
you might use a dungeon under a city as a justification for all
sorts of monsters wandering that city.
</UL>

<H2>2. Idea and Background</H2>

<P>
To create a good dungeon, you have to do more than simply throw
monsters below ground. A good dungeon has a background.
<P>
Look at these points. They will influence how the dungeon looks,
and often also which creatures reside in it.
<UL>
<LI><B>Who created the dungeon?:</B> is the dungeon a former dwarven
city? If so, where are the dwarves? A dungeon constructed by duergar
should look different from a dungeon built by drow. (also remember
a dwarven city will have 6 feet high ceilings (at most).
<LI><B>With what purpose was the dungeon built?:</B> everything
is done with a purpose. Think of this well, for it can affect
many factors. A dungeon built to house a small community looks
like a city. A mine is again very different.
<LI><B>When was it built?:</B> this entry is also important, for
it influences the state of buildings, and perhaps the available
technology and magic used.
<LI><B>How was it built?:</B> if the constructors had access to
powerful magics and earth elementals, the dungeon looks different
from one created with hammer and spike.
<LI><B>Air, Food, Water?:</B> nobody builds a dungeon without
thinking of getting fresh air, food and water. Think about this
very carefully and come up with a good solution.
<LI><B>Waste Deposits?:</B> almost as important as where food
and water comes from is the issue of where the waste goes to.
Therefore, it deserves as much tought.
</UL>

<P>
The above are just a few points to consider. With some thought,
you can think of many more. Also, this is the time to write down
any special ideas you might have regarding the creation of a dungeon.
<H2>3. History</H2>

<P>
Your dungeon needs a history, just like a campaign does. This
history need not be elaborate. It should just sum up the important
events that have happened to the dungeon since it was first created.
<P>
For an abandoned dwarven city, you need to at least sketch out
what happened to the dwarves. Perhaps they warred with a drow
city and lost?
<H2>4. Major Villains</H2>

<P>
Often (but not always), a dungeon has someone controlling it.
This character should be fleshed out now. Even if there is nobody
in control, there can still be important powers at work. A very
large dungeon might house several diferent humanoid races. Perhaps
the most powerful of these are the drow. If so, this will influence
the traps and amount of magic in the dungeon. (drow are infamous
for their magical abilties).
<P>
When describing this villain, consider his motiviations. Why does
he live in the dungeon? (doesn't he?) Who are his friends? Who
are his enemies? What are his goals? How is his relationship with
others in the dungeon?
<P>
If your players are to confront the villain, you will also need
game statistics.
<P>
Even if they wont confront him, it might be fun or neccessary
to write up a short description of his behaviour and appearance.
If he's powerful, the players might hear of him from someone else.
<P>
Summary:
<UL>
<LI>motivation
<LI>goals
<LI>friends, enemies, servants
<LI>(game stats)
<LI>appearance
<LI>behaviour
</UL>

<H2>5. Other Powers</H2>

<P>
Next to the main villains, consider other permanent powers. You
should include those the players will encounter, as well as those
that make a significant impact on the dungeon.
<H2>6. Mapping</H2>

<P>
It is very unlikely that you will not need a dungeon map. A good
idea is to draw it on graph paper, with one square representing
5, 10, 50 or even 100 feet, depending on dungeon and paper size.
<P>
<B>Step-by-step:</B>
<UL>
<LI>draw the map
<LI>number the rooms (can be done from top to bottom, or starting
where the players enter and working through the dungeon, or any
other logical method)
</UL>

<P>
<B>Things to consider:</B>
<P>
Creatures that permanently live underground need many things.
The most obvious are air, food and water. Make sure you include
them on the map.
<P>
Also consider actvities. What do the creatures do (or what did
the dungeon builders do)? Perhaps they spend most of their time
mining. If so, this should be shown on your map.
<H2>7. The Real Stuff</H2>

<P>
All you need to do now is fill in the dungeon. For small ones,
you might just wish to include keys to the rooms and stats for
major adversaries.
<P>
For larger dungeons, there can be numerous things you might want
to write up:
<UL>
<LI><B>room descriptions.</B> Note inhabitants, furniture, traps,
magic, treasure, and sensory information (what do players see,
feel, smell, hear, taste).
<LI><B>generic description of layout.</B> For large dungeons it
is not practical to give a description for every corridor. Rather,
you can describe what these corridors are usually like.
<LI><B>generic rules and notes.</B> Anything that applies to the
dungeon as a whole should be written down only once. This includes
things like special effects on magic, temperature, appearance
of doors, sources of water, food and air, and more.
<LI><B>tables, tables, tables.</B> It can be very useful to make
up tables for a variety of things: traps, pits, sounds, events,
&#133;
<LI><B>wandering creatures.</B> Many of the dungeon's inhabitants
don't just sit around in a room all day. They wander their lairs,
and very often beyond.
<LI><B>food-chain.</B> Perhaps this sounds odd, but it is very
important. Everything eats and is eaten. Figure out your complete
food chain. If the tarrasque lives here, make sure you put some
cattle in!
</UL>

<CENTER>
On Traps
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Before you adorn your dungeon with traps, you need to solve one
thing:
<P>
Who set up all these traps? And why?
<P>
This is especially true for magical traps. Perhaps you think of
it as nice, but it isn't logical for dwarves (can't be wizards)
to fill their underground city with magical traps.
<H3>
<CENTER>
On Entrances and Exits
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Just to make sure you think about this&#133;<BR>
If there are a lot of creatures in the dungeon that would prefer
to be somewhere else (as is often the case), you'll have to make
getting out of the thing very hard.
<H3>
<CENTER>
On Organisation
</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
For large dungeons, material can quickly get hard to find. Here's
how I usually organise my dungeons:
<P>
I start with an introduction to the dungeon. I tend to include
some short notes for myself on books that are referred to, since
I own a variety of resources. I have a few notes about my intended
usage of the dungeon, when I wrote the stuff, and other things
that I might think can be useful later.
<P>
Then comes a general history. Depending on the dungeon size, this
history can be short or elaborate. I try to have at least a typed
A4 on this.
<P>
The next section has general information on appearance of the
rooms, encounter tables, wandering monster descriptions, descriptions
of major villains, power groups and magical effects; basically
anything general.
<P>
The last part are the rooms.
<H2>For the Novice</H2>

<P>
The above may sound really nice, but lots of you don't want to
spend too much time on this. Here is a quick way:
<UL>
<LI>sketch the dungeon background in one or two alineas.
<LI>draw the map
<LI>decide on who or what your major villain is, and write up
the stats.
<LI>write the room descriptions
<LI>write encounter tables, and some possible plots and adventure
hooks.
<LI>review for inconsistencies and change things so everything
works.
<LI>done!
</UL>

<P>
Some suggestions that ease creation:
<UL>
<LI><B>make the dungeon lineair</B>. That means there is only
one exit/entrance. His way, you do not have to spend time developing
things your players will never see.
<LI><B>make the dungeon description general as general as possible.</B>
You need only one description of doors (or perhaps one for reinforced,
and one for common doors). You can use these many times. This
goes for many more things, like runes, pits, spell enchantments,
and so on.
<LI><B>Improvise:</B> if you are able to imporvise, leave room
to do so. Not every room needs an elaborate description that you
read to the players. Just write quick notes on contents, creatures,
traps, and sensory information.
<LI><B>use waste-devouring creatures.</B> The most famous are
Otyughs, Carrion Crawlers and slimes, though you can always think
up your own.
