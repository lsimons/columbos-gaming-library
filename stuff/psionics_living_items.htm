This book is an expansion of psionicist rules and powers, written
with the Dark Sun campaign world in mind, but usable with any
campaign. It's not as detailed as the other Player's Option books,
but then again, I'm not TSR.

<P>
The Psionicist is a class that is usually limited in it's abilities
(there wasn't a character point system for psionicists in Skills
and Powers). In this book there are new psionicist classes and
abilities to choose from. Also the psionic progression is altered:
now you can choose to gain more powers, or to gain lesser powers,
but be able to use them much more often.
<P>
The psionicist class is now split into 3 classes: Psionicists,
Wild Talents and Users of the Force. The last one is a class intended
for multi- or dual-class play.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc392390276">The Psionicist</A></H1>

<P>
The psionicist is the most common adventurer in the Dark Sun world.
He works to mold mind, body and spirit into a unified, powerful
whole. The hero's internal energy, his psionic strength, comes
fro mdeep within himself, from a place called the nexus.
<P>
All psionicists must meet the following 
<P>
<I>Requiments:</I> Constitution/ Fitness 13, Intelligence/ Reason
14, Wisdom/ Willpower 17.
<P>
<I>Prime Requisites:</I> Wisdom, Constitution.
<P>
<I>Races Allowed:</I> Any
<P>
Any character of any race can be a psionicist and advance to any
level, if they meet these required scores. Psionicists can be
multi-classed, with no penalty. (they do have to abide by the
restricitions stated in chapter 3 of th PHB.) Human Psionicists
may be dual-classed, but they must abide by the same restrictions
as other dual-classed characters.
<P>
Psionicists may have any non-chaotic alignment.
<P>
Psionicists disdain using weapons, and are limited to small-sized
weapons, which do 1d6 damage or less.
<P>
Psionicists may only use padded, leather, studded leather and
hide armor. They may also use small shields and bucklers.
<P>
All Psionicists use the table here to determine their advancement
in levels.
<P>
All Psionicists use the saving throw table on page 149 of <I>Skills
and Powers.</I>
<P>
Psionicists have THAC0s equal to those of rogues.
<P>
Psionicists have a MTHAC0 that improves at a rate of 1 per level.
<P>
Psionicists gain Disciplines, Sciences and Devotions as indicated
on the table on page 154 of <I>Skills and Powers.</I>
<P>
Psionicists may use the standard psionicist rules from Skills
and Powers, or they may choose to customize their psionicist using
the system below.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390277">Psionicists and Character Points</A>
</H3>

<P>
Psionicists get 40 CPs, which they may spent on the following
abilities:
<UL>
<LI><B>Armor Allowance (10/15):</B> The Psionicist may use armor.
For 15 points, he may use armor up to chain mail (instead of up
to Studded Leather.)
<LI><B>Attack Specialization (10):</B> The psionicist is good
at using psionicist attacks, gaining a +1 bonus on MTHAC0 rolls
vs. Character MACs and doing an extra +2 bonus on the PSP damage.Also,
the Psionicist gains extra psionic attacks faster as normal:<BR>
Level: 1-6 7-12 13+<BR>
# of attacks: 3/2 2/1 5/2
<LI><B>Bonus PSPs (5):</B> The psionicist gains an extra PSP at
each level of experience.
<LI><B>Charm Resistance (10):</B> The Psionicist gains a +2 on
Saving Throws vs. charm-related spells.
<LI><B>Combat Bonus (10):</B> The psionicist is much better in
combat than normal. He uses the priest THAC0 chart.
<LI><B>Constitution Adjustment (5):</B> The Psionicist may use
the constitution-based hit point bonus of warriors.
<LI><B>Contact (3):</B> The psionicist can participate in psionic
combat.
<LI><B>Detect Psionics (10):</B> The psionicist can detect psionic
activity (the expenditure of PSPs) in a path 10 feet wide and
60 feet long. Chance of Succes is 10%, plus the psionicists wisdom
score and his level.
<LI><B>Dis/Sci/Dev Progression (10):</B> The Psionicist gains
Disciplines, Sciences and Devotions as normal.
<LI><B>Fast Recovery (10):</B> The psionicist recovers his PSPs
faster, at a rate of 1/6 of his total per hour.
<LI><B>followers (5/10):</B> The psionicist gains followers as
described in Skills and Powers. By spending 10 CPs, he gains these
followers at 2nd level.
<LI><B>Improved Hit Die (10/20):</B> For 10 CPs, the psionicist
uses a d8 for a Hit Die instead of a d6. For 20, he uses a d10.
<LI><B>Improved MTHAC0 (10):</B> The Psionicist gains a +2 bonus
on his MTHAC0.
<LI><B>Persistent Power (10 +2 per point of maintainance cost):</B>
The Psionicist may select one Devotion he knows to have a persistent,
permanent duration. He permanently looses the PSPs that this power
costs. By concentrating, the wizard may activate the power and
maintian it for as long as he continues to concentrate. For example,
a persistent All-Round vision would cost 20 CPs and reduce the
psionicist PSP total by 5, permanently.
<LI><B>Point Progression (15):</B> The Psionicist gains Disciplines,
Sciences and Devotions using the system described here: The psionicist
gets disciplines as normal, and gains a number of points to spent
on his sciences and devotions. A science costs 2 points, a devotion
costs one point. The psionicist starts with 5 points at first
level, and gains 3 points every level afterwards.<BR>
<I>Masha, a 3rd lvl psionicist, uses this system to purchase her
powers. She chooses Psychometabolism as a Prime Discipline, and
Psychokinetism as a second Discipline. Now she has 11 (5+3+3)
points to spent on sciences and disciplines. She could take 5
disciplines and 1 devotion, or 1 science and 9 devotions. Or she
could purchase 2 sciences and 7 devotions, which is what a psionicist
normally has at 3rd level.</I>
<LI><B>Preparation Time reduction (3/5):</B> The initiative phase
of the PCs psionic powers goes up by one phase. For 2 CPs, the
psionicist may accelerate the powers from his primary discipline
only. For 5 CPs, all powers are faster.
<LI><B>Proficiency group crossovers (5+):</B> Normally, a psionicist
may select proficiencies from the psionicist and general group.
At a cost of 5 CPs each, the psionicist may select another character
group for a NWP crossover.
<LI><B>Range Increase (5/7):</B> All ranges from the psionicists
primary discipline increase by 25% for 5 CPs or by 50% for 7 PSPs.This
does not apply to powers with a range of personal or touch.
<LI><B>Thief Ability (10+):</B> The psionicist may selct one thief
ability of his choice. For every 5 additional points he spents,
he may choose another thief ability. The psionicists scores increase
as indicated on table 19 in the DMG.
<LI><B>Weapon Selection (10/15):</B> For 10 CPs, the psionicist
may expand his weapon selection to either the cleric or thief
list (players choice.) For 15 CPs, he is completely unrestricted
in his choice of weapons.
<LI><B>Weapon Specialization (15):</B> With this power, the psionicist
gains the ability to specialize in a particular weapon. Choosing
this ability doesn't confer specialization - it merely makes it
available to the psionicist, who is still required to spend the
necessary CPs on proficiency slots to actually aquire the specialization.
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc392390278">Wild Talents</A></H1>

<P>
The Idea of Wild Talents is known: everyone has the Will to be
a psionicist, but not everyone has the Way. From now on, nobody
is a Wild Talent automatically anymore. One has to select the
Wild Talent Subclass: a class available only as a secondary class.
<P>
All normal rules regarding wild talents apply. There's no Character
Point System for Wild Talents.
<P>
The good side on this is that players can now choose their Devotion
to know (no prime requisites allowed.) Below is the experience
table:

</PRE>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc392390279">Users of the Force</A></H1>

<P>
Users of the Force (more often called force-users) are more than
just Wild Talents. They are adventurers who studied the Way for
some time, but they do not have they great command of the nexus
psionicists have.
<P>
Users of the Force have MTHAC0s and PSPs equal to Wild Talents.
However, they gain disciplines, Sciences and Devotions at a rate
almost equal to that of psionicists. They start with 5 points,
to spent on sciences and devotions, using the system described
under Point Progression, described above. After those 5 points,
the gain 2 points per level. So a 3rd level Force-user has 9 points,
which he could use for 9 devotions, 4 sciences and a devotion,
etcetera.
<P>
Force-users get 10 CPs, to use on the abilities above. They may
also use any points normally reserved for other classes. (a Gladiator/Force-user
may opt to spend the 10 CPs he normally gains and 10 CPs from
his gladiator-character points to gain a persistent all-round
vision.
<P>
Force-users should not be played as a stand-alone class, and many
things that normal classes do have (saving throws, hit dice) are
not applicaciable for Force-users. The experience table for Force-users
appears below:

<P>
You might have noticed that I use the new psionics system from
The Way of the Psionicist/ Skills and Powers. This is simply because
I do not own the Complete Psionics Handbook, and for me, these
rules work fine&#133;almost. I hope that with al little adaptions,
you can use this book with those rules (bonuses on Power Scores
instead of on MAC, and so on.)
<P>
The new rules here are presented to make the psionic combat system
even faster and to be able to use all of this with the Players
Option: Combat and Tactics book.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390281">Initiative</A></H3>

<P>
Take a look at the initiative rules for psionics in the Comabt
and Tactics book: 
<P>
<B>Random Initiative:</B>
<P>
<B>d10 roll:* Base Phase</B>
<P>
1-2 Vf
<P>
3-4 Fa
<P>
5-6 Av
<P>
7-8 Sl
<P>
9-10 Vs
<P>
*add the powers preparation time to this roll.
<P>
Not very refined, is it? The new rule is as follows: the initiative
of a Psionic Attack is Fast, with additional at a penalty of one
phase, just as multiple weapon attacks. The use of activated powers
is handled in the Very fast phase, before ANY other actions. The
activation of new powers happens at a characters base initiative
phase, although never in the same phase as a psionic attack.
<P>
If a character doesn't use a psionic power (but does use a psionic
attack), he may take a half-move after the psionic attack.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390282">Knockdowns</A></H3>

<P>
There are little psionics that cause knockdowns. Those that do
(ballistic attack, for example) do not need special rules: simply
use common sense and make up the knockdown roll. Psionic Attacks
do not cause knockdowns.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390283">Psionic Attacks</A></H3>

<P>
This optional rule is a rule to make psionic combat somewhat faster:
no special psionic attacks or defenses are used anymore, there's
just the amount of psionic strength points put in the attack and
the amount of psionic damage caused. Of course, players are still
encouraged to describe the form of their psionic attack. A table
for figuring out psionic damage is here.
<P>
Also, Defense Modes are not used anymore. A psionicist (or wild
talent, or Force-User) has a MAC based on his level (be careful
not to allow players to put 10 CPs in the Mental Armor proficiency;
this will result in VERY low MACs.) Tables below:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
Level      MAC    
(psionicis        
t)                

1-2        9      

3-4        8      

5-6        7      

7-8        6      

9+         5      

Level       MAC    
(wild              
talent)            

1-4         10     

5-8         9      

9-12        8      

13-16       7      

17-20       6      

21+         5      


</PRE>

<P>
For those of you who want to use the rules described above, but
still want to create special effects with the attacks:
<P>
<B>PSPs put in the attack: Effect</B>
<P>
1-2 Knock down victim
<P>
3-5 <I>Stun</I> for 1d4 rounds (as <I>power word, stun</I>)
<P>
6-11 Victim loses one psionic power (determine randomly)
<P>
12-20 Victim loses 1d10 hit points
<P>
21+ Victim has to make a succesful system shock or fall unconscious

1d10 damage.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390284">Area Boost</A></H3>

<P>
By increasing the PSP cost of a power by 50%, the psionicist may
increase the area of effect by 25%. For example, a psionicist
may want to use detonate on an object of 10 cubic feet. By paying
23 PSPs, he can do so.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc392390285">Psionic Research</A></H1>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc392390286">Psionic Power Research</A></H1>

<P>
Psionicists may researh new psionics if they wish to. This allows
a psionicist to truly surprise a victim - after all there arent
so much psionic powers around.
<P>
Unlike wizards or priests, psionicists don't need laboratories
or libraries to create new psionics. All that is required is a
place where the psionicist will not be disturbed and enough food
and water. A simple building in a remote village (or even better,
on an Island in the Silt Sea) is all that's required. In addition
a psionicist needs time.
<P>
Psionicists actually &quot;research&quot; powers every time they
advance a level. They do not need anyone to help them in the research.
Researching custom-created powers is as easy as learning one from
the book. It takes 1 week for a devotion, and 2 weeks for a science.
In addition to that, psionicists must spend 1 week in meditation
for ever PSP the psionic power costs (meaning a Death Field would
take 37 weeks to learn!) Psionicists are NOT allowed to research
powers beyond what they are allowed.
<P>
Some things to bear in mind:
<UL>
<LI>MAC: Don't make this to high or to low. A power which has
an area of &quot;Personal&quot; should seldom have a MAC of lower
than 4.
<LI>PSP Cost: Compare the power to the others. Use your common
sense. Powers that inflict or heal big amounts of damage (Ultrablast,
Death Field, etc.) should be above 20. Powers which go beyond
Athas (summon planar creature, etc.) should also have a significant
cost.
<LI>Range: remember that psionics require line of sight (some
powers, like many clairsentient ones are an exception.)
<LI>Area Of Effect: Psionics that require physical contact (range:
touch) should reguire less PSPs as those that don't.
<LI>Prerequisite: Common Sense should also be used here. If a
power teleports something, this should be teleport. If a power
moves an object, telekinesis would be required, and so on.
</UL>

<P>
Remember: the DM always has the final word for any power.
<H1><A NAME="_Toc392390287">Psionic Item Research</A></H1>

<P>
The research of psionic items is discussed in The Complete Psionics
Handbook, but those rules might differ a lot from those you will
find here.
<P>
I divide psionic items into three different categories:
<OL>
<LI>Non-permanent items
<LI>Non-intelligent items
<LI>Normal Psionic Items
<LI>Teaching Items
<LI>Channeling Items
<LI>Psionic Artifacts
</OL>

<P>
The first category is the easiest of them all. These items usually
come in the form of enchanted berries, or small items with a limited
number of PSPs (like a Ring of the Ram, which could easily be
created as a Psionic Item.)
<P>
Non-Intelligent items are very rare, but this category is one
of the most useful items. It includes items that simply burst
the characters PSP total, MTHAC0, and so on.
<P>
Normal Psionic Items are items that have a (at least) limited
intelligence and reasoning ability. These items are aligned, and
can regain their PSPs, just like psionicists.
<P>
Teaching Items grand their users the ability to use psionic powers
normally beyond their powers, or to teach someone abilities beyond
what they normally could (i.e. granting Wild Talents extra devotions
and stuff)
<P>
Channeling items don't have a PSP pool of their own, but instead
rely on the energy of the user for their powers. Some possibilities
are staves that <I>Banish</I> every creature pointed at, or a
shield which projects an Inertial Barrier. The advantage to this
is that the psionicist need not concentrate for the power to work.
<P>
Psionic Artifacts are even rarer than 'normal' artifacts, and
their only exist two or three in the entire Dark Sun world (an
example is the <I>Psionatrix</I>.) These cannot be created by
PCs.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390288">Who can use Psionic Items?</A></H3>

<P>
Only characters who have a PSP pool (anyone who is a Wild Talent)
may use Psionic Items. There are a lot of items restricted to
psionicists and Force-users. Wild Talents can only use the Non-permanent
items, non-intelligent items and the teaching items. Only the
rarest of psionical artifacts are usable by anyone.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390289">Who can create Psionic Items?</A>
</H3>

<P>
The ability to construct psionic items is limited to psionicists
only. When a psionicist reaches 9th level, he may attempt to create
non-permanent items. At 11th level, he may create non-intelligent
items. It's at 13th level when a psionicist finally learns to
create other psionic items.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390290">How does one create Psionic Items?</A>
</H3>

<P>
Non-permanent and non-intelligent items can be created by finding
the right materials and then using the <I>Imbue with Energy</I>
science. This power can only be learned from another psionicist
who already has the power or via a teaching item. If one is on
fighting terms with the Order, creating psionic items may get
a little difficult&#133;
<P>
Creating other Psionics Items is even more difficult. The psionicist
must know the <I>Imbue with Energy</I> science and the <I>Imbue
with Life Force</I> devotion. The same rule regarding <I>Imbue
with Energy</I> is true for <I>Imbue with Life Force.</I> The
problem with these items is that there are very little items that
are capable of holding life, and finding one which can hold the
right energy (the right power) is even more difficult.
<P>
Creating a Psionic Item is very difficult. One must find the right
materials, materials that are capable of holding the energy of
the psionicist. This is different for all psionicists, since every
creature in the universe has a somewhat different aura. Generally,
non-permanent and non-intelligent items require 'real world' materials
(that is, a chunk of gold or the roots from a defiled Tree of
Life.) Other items require things even rarer (the goodness of
a Sorceror-King, the Golden Hair of a Dwarf) materials.
<P>
Psionic Items need not be of the finest quality, but they have
to be crafted by the most skilled artist in the world (one way
to find the materials to create a psionic ring is to become the
best ring maker of the world.) These items as such cost loads
of gold (lets say 10 gp for a nice, big wand.)
<P>
After one has found and assembled the right materials, one can
begin to prepare the item for contact. This means spending much
time with the item, forming a emotional bond with it and caring
for it a great deal (painting a wooden staff with a potion of
Youth would qualify, for example.) Once this is done, the psionicist
can make contact with the item via an <I>Imbue with Energy</I>,
and send the energy and psionic powers into the item. If the item
is going to be permanent, an <I>Imbue With Life Force</I> should
be used instead.
<P>
All of this has to be done in absolute seclusion from all other
intelligent beings, in a place where spirits gather. These meditation
Dojo's should be decorated with things that will comfort the spirits.
All in all, a Dojo will generally cost between 1.000 and 10.000
SP, depending on location and the type of item the psionicist
wants to create. Unlike wizard laboratories, dojo's don't need
any attention after they are built.
<P>
If the psionicist has performed all these actions, he must hope
to attract a spirit to house in the item (in case of permanent
items). If his Imbue With Life Force is succesful, the item is
finished. (after more than a year of traveling, searching, adventuring,
polishing, dying, and spending money.)
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390291">Imbue with Energy (Telepathic Science)</A>
</H3>

<P>
MAC: 0
<P>
PSP Cost: 80/20
<P>
Range: touch
<P>
Area of Effect: one object
<P>
Prerequisite: 9th level
<P>
This power is used by psionicists to create Psionic Items. After
the psionicst has finished all steps necessary for the creation
of such an item, this power is used.
<P>
The psionicist focuses all the energy from his nexus into one
big ball of energy. He then transfers this energy to the object.
When this is done, the psionicist falls into a coma that lasts
1d8 days.
<P>
After this period, in which the spirit of the psionicist is both
in the body of the psionicist and in the item, he must roll a
succesful MTHAC0 versus MAC -5. If this roll is succesful, he
may charge the item with the powers he wants it to have, needing
one round of PSP expenditure per power. After this he may charge
(or re-charge) the item by letting his own PSPs flow into the
item. 
<P>
If the roll was not succesful, the psionicist has to use this
power again. To create Psionic Items that have a permanent effect,
one needs to use the <I>Imbue with Life Force</I> devotion.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390292">Imbue with Life Force (Telepathic
Devotion)</A></H3>

<P>
MAC: -2
<P>
PSP Cost: 100/30
<P>
Range: Touch
<P>
Area of Effect: one object
<P>
Prerequisite: 11th level, Imbue with Energy, psychic surgery
<P>
A Psionicist uses this power to create a permanently lasting psionic
item. He enters a meditative state, from which nothing but death
can pull him. In this state, he searches for a suitable spirit
to inhabit the item. Finding this spirit takes between 1 and 19
days.(1d20) If the psionicist rolls a 20, he hasn't got the right
bonding with the item, and has to start all over bonding with
it again.
<P>
When he has found this spirit, he transfers it into the item.
His own body acts as a channel, and there is a 2 procent chance
that the spirit will not leave his body (roll 1d100.) If this
occurs, the characters personality is split up, and he's in control
of his actions only 50% of the time. (curable with Psionic Surgery,
Wish or Restoration only)
<P>
When the spirit has entered the item, he must learn it the psionics
he wants it to know (using psychic surgery). This takes between
2 and 10 months, depending on the power of the psionics. When
this is done, he has finished creating the item. While the psionicist
has some control over the spirit that will enter the item (alignment,
intelligence), some other motivations or powers might not be known
to him (possible other psionics, hatred for specific creatures,
etc.)
<P>
In the case a psionicist wishes to create a learning item, he
must find a spirit who already knows the power he wants the item
to have. This multiplies all durations by 3.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc392390293">Sword of Combat Ability</A></H4>

<P>
This sword contains the life force of a dwarven gladiator, who
died because he lost a battle against 3 half-giants.
<P>
It has the powers All-Round Vision, Combat Mind, Project Force,
Inertial Barrier and Adrenaline Control.
<P>
The sword has a special hatred for Half-Giants, and will try to
gain power over its controller whenever it meets one. It will
then attack the Half-Giant with special project force, which expends
all PSPs left in the sword and does 1 damage per PSP.
<P>
PSP: 140

EGO: 18
<H1><A NAME="_Toc392390294">Sample Psionic Items</A></H1>

<P>
Below are a few samples of psionic items. These are typical forms
psionic items may take. Every psionic item is different: there
aren't 2 spirits in the universe that are completely alike. This
means all intellignet psionical items can be create only once.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390295">Non-Permanent Items</A></H3>

<P>
These items can sometimes be recharged. This is done by using
the Imbue with Energy power. The psionicist simply uses the power
again on the item to be recharged.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc392390296">Rod of Telekinesis</A></H4>

<P>
PSP pool: 125
<P>
This psionical ring empowers the user to move objects without
pysically touching them, using <I>telekinesis</I>. The psionicist
points at the object and then moves it to where he wants. The
rod has 250 PSPs, and can be recharged as normally (250 PSP max.)
<H4><A NAME="_Toc392390297">Fruits of Higher Consciousness</A>
</H4>

<P>
These magical berries, when eaten, allow the user to enter a higher
state of consciousness. While in this state, the user temporarily
gains 2 points of intelligence and wisdom, a +2 bonus on MTHAC
0 rolls and one-phase initiative bonus. This state lasts for 1d3
turns. There usually are 1d6+6 berries when found.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390298">Non-Intelligent Items</A></H3>

<P>
These items generally boost a targets psionic abilities, but do
not grand psionic powers to the user. These items are created
using a Imbue with Life Force, but the contain the spirits of
creatures of semi- or animal intelligence.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc392390299">Necklace of the Psionicist</A></H4>

<P>
This necklace is made of silver, and imbued with 7 red diamonds.
Each of these diamonds grants the user extra PSPs. The big diamond
in the center grants the user 20 extra PSPs and a +2 bonus on
MTHAC 0. The other, smaller diamonds each boost the PSP total
of the psionicist by 10.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390300">Normal Psionic Items</A></H3>

<P>
These items should be created using the rules for intelligent
items found in the DMG. The psionicist chooses the alignment,
and the DM determines, not rolls the intelligence and communication
capabilities of the item. More powerful items are generally more
intelligent. The DM may choose a Special Purpose for the item
as he sees fit. A Lawful Good item with Aura Sight and Ballistic
Attack might automatically attack Defilers.
<P>
The Ego of the item is determined as follows:
<P>
per 20 PSPs 1
<P>
per science 2
<P>
per devotion 1
<P>
Special Purpose 5
<P>
semi-empathy 1
<P>
empathy 2
<P>
speech 3
<P>
telepathy 4
<P>
A item with 200 PSPs, 3 sciences and 5 devotions would have a
base ego of 21. The DM decides the spirit that inhabits the item
was a druid, with a hatred for defilers. Since the item has an
intelligence of 16, he assingnes it the common and Nibenese language,
and has the item use it's special ability on every defiler it
encounters. This ability is the spell curse. The item has 26 ego
points. An example of a psionic item is here.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc392390301">Libram of Body Adjustment</A></H4>

<P>
This book tells the reader how to alter their body in special
ways. It teaches the user the Metamorphosis science and the Body
Control, Body Equilibrium and Chameleon Power devotions.
<P>
The book will refuse to be read by others than its rightful owner.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390302">Teaching Psionic Items</A></H3>

<P>
These items are seldom created by psionicists, because they do
not benefit the psionicist themselves. The psionicist can only
create a learning item to teach someone the powers he already
has.
<P>
Teaching items form a bond with those they teach a power and stay
with this user until his death. If, for some reason, a teaching
item will be ripped from its possesor before his death, the item
will cease to function for 1d10+10 years.
<P>
Teaching items usually are non-aligned and do not have special
purposes or powers. Only in the rarest occasions will and should
the DM rule otherwise (a item which is capable of a Death Field
could be aligned.) Teaching items also cannot use the power they
instruct themselves, because they lack a PSP pool.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390303">Channeling Items</A></H3>

<P>
Channeling items are much like normal psionic items, the only
difference is that they lack a PSP pool of their own. This, however,
makes it much easier to handle the item: there is no ego bonus
for PSPs. For example, The Sword of Combat Ability would have
an ego of 11 instead of 18.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc392390304">Psionic Artifacts</A></H3>

<P>
Psionic artifacts are the area of the DM only. These items have
awesome psionics, for they usually are a psionicist who transformed
himself into an item to stay alive. This makes the item very powerful
(all the powers and knowledge of a 20st level psionicist!) Even
then there are more powerful items, like the <I>psionatrix</I>.
These items do not have PSPs; they don't need them. They grant
the user the permanent use of powerful psionics. Psionics Artifacts
should follow all the rules for Magical Artifacts and Relics in
the DMG.

<H1><A NAME="_Toc392390305">New Psionic Powers</A></H1>

<P>
<B>SPECIAL NOTE:</B> these powers are still in my home language,
dutch. I maybe update them, maybe not (after all, you don't need
them, I created them for my own campaign) This is as far as it
goes for now. Nature-Masters and living items will come later&#133;
<P>
This chapter presents some new psionic powers (be aware: their
names aren't new!!!). The powers listed here are for the Players
Option psionic system. For those of you who use the Complete Psionics
Handbook, here's a rule for transforming these psionics to the
other rules:
<P>
To figure out the scores for powers with names from the CPhB,
uses power scores, maintainance costs, initial costs and preparation
times from that book. For other powers (that maybe will come after
these), you should take the difference between MAC 10 and the
powers MAC and take this as the penalty to the power score. For
the power score, choose whatever score you want. Initial costs
are 1.5 times the PSP cost, maintainance cost 0.75 times the cost
(round up.)
<P>
To transform psionic powers to the new system, use the following
rule of thumb: the MAC is 10, with the power score penalty subtracted.
(thus a power score of INT-8 becomes MAC 2.) To calculate the
PSP cost, add maintainance and initial cost and divide them by
2. This is the PSP cost. The cost for a failed attempt is &#189;
of that.

<H1>About Living Items</H1>

<P>
There has not been a heck of a lot information on Nature-Masters
and Nature-Benders from the side of TSR, and there isn't very
much on the Net either. This is my own vision on Living Items,
probably different from that of everybody else, but this is true
about most things.
<P>
The way I see it, the ancient halflings were a society dedicated
to knowledge, and less to material stuff. They wanted to know
everything about the world, creating huge catalogs with pictures
and descriptions of plants, creatures and other things.
<P>
Through this quest for knowledge, the halflings eventually discovered
'something' about nature, how the world was created, by whom,
and for what reason (any of these could be true, I don't know.)
They learned about the building blocks of all living things, about
atoms, DNA and other stuff. They started manipulating these strange
new patterns in some way, creating living items and new creatures.
<P>
I see the halflings as scientists, working in clean, sterile environments
with tissue samples, but not with modern equipment like computers.
At first, the process of altering DNA was very slow, and the halflings
had little progress. But when they started creating living items
to aid them in creating other living items, everything speeded
up. (somewhat like the super-duper-fast neuronetworks in Star
Trek Voyager, aiding the halflings in every way.)
<P>
As the Nature-Masters grew more powerful, the society became more
and more dependant on the living items. The buildings were replaced
by living buildings, as were the chairs, the hunting equipment,
the boats, the beds, the knives, everything. The new cities had
a far greater capacity as the old ones. The population grew. As
the population grew, so did the crime. Many criminals found a
life among the halflings. Eventually, a group of Nature-Masters
created a plan for taking control over halfling society.
<P>
A war started between the Nature-Masters and the Nature-Benders,
both groups aided by the few Elemental Clerics that existed at
that time.
<P>
From here, I've modified the original history a bit. Since the
Nature-Benders in the end knew the were going to be defeated by
the Nature-Masters, they created a living weapon of immense power,
and moved it beyond the known world. The Nature-Masters defeated
the Nature-Benders, and everyone was happy again. However, the
living weapon grew stronger and stronger, consuming everything
around it; creatures, water, plants, everything.
<P>
This creature eventually stretched all across Athas, except for
the area populated by the Halflings. Then it decided to expand
further, to engulf all of Athas. When the Nature-Masters learned
of the Brown Tide, they sought for a way to destroy it. They created
the Prisitine Tower, to focus the sun's energy into the tide,
hoping to destroy it's essence.
<P>
The Nature-Masters succeed, but next to destroying the brown Tide,
the radiation from the sun kills most halflings and vaporises
much water. The few surviving halflings are mutated by the Radiation,
until they find forms which become immune to it. Only a vague
memory of the original principles of the alteration of life remains,
in rituals to create the items.
<P>
The Nature-Masters had all this, and prepared for it. They selected
one from among their members, and altered his DNA so that he would
not die from age, and changed his arm into a reptile appendache.
This Selected One would make sure none of the new races would
ever corrupt nature in such a terrifying way. This last decendant
of the original nature masters still wanders Athas, visiting the
different races, watching their advancement and inventions. This
Selected One is known by the name &quot;The Wanderer&quot;&#133;
<P>
Theoretically, the limitation of the living items is what could
be possible on our world. Lightning is possible on our world,
so a living item that can create lightning is possible. However,
any psionics or magic is not possible on Earth (at least, it is
<U>not scientifically</U> proved), so there cannot be a living
item that <I>teleports</I>, or a living item that grants <I>wishes</I>,
or a living item that grants <I>telekinesis</I>&#133;
<P>
Another limitation is being capable of surviving. An elephant
can survive, a human can survive, but could a Titan survive. Theoretically,
a Titan could not exist (but since these are magical creatures,
this is not a problem.) A living item must have some source of
energy, be it raw energy, atomenergy, energy from ordinary food,
energy from the sun, it does not matter.
<P>
To determine what can and what cannot exist, use your common sense.
A flee lives, but a flee the size of a human does not exist. Why
not? Because flees survive by drinking blood, and a creature that
can give a giant flee that amount of blood does not <U>exist</U>
on Earth.
<P>
The ancient halflings created blobs of living flesh that used
the same form of gathering energy as plants to survive, in many
shapes. Whole cities of this living flesh were created, all these
things being unintelligent, really like a combination between
a mountain and a tree.
<P>
The Nature-Benders did something very dangerous: they gave the
living items intelligence. These items could think, and when not
careful enough, one can create a living item much to intelligent,
oor one which has the wrong alignment, or one which wishes to
take over the earth, etc.
<P>
From this follows that the creation of living items is very hard,
and the creation of intelligent living items is even harder. As
a Nature-Master creates becomes more experienced, he can create
bigger, more complex items. A beginning Nature-Master perhaps
has the ability to create a walking chair, but he certainly cannot
create a whole city, which feeds on the remains of dinner, can
contain 20,000 souls, and manages to survive.
<P>
I have created a (sort of) (Non-player)character class: the Nature
Master, and another one, the Nature Bender.

<H1>Nature-Master</H1>

<P>
The Nature-Master is an NPC class, but it is usable as a PC class,
but only if you desire so (and then the Nature-Master will still
be a very rare class.)
<P>
ABILITY REQUIRMENTS: Int 15, Wis 12
<P>
PRIME REQUISITES: Intelligence, Wisdom
<P>
RACES ALLOWED: Halfling, Human
<P>
Nature-Masters are like much like wizards in many ways. Both wizards
and Nature-Masters are weak in physical combat. Both are not understood
and feared by common people. Both command strange powers.
<P>
One has to have great intellect and wisdom to become a Nature-Master.
The only races that are allowed to become Nature-Masters are Halflings
and Humans.
<P>
Nature-Masters do not belong to a particular group (i.e. warrior,
rogue, etc.) but are treated as an entire different class on its
own. Nature-Masters are weak in combat, and cannot use magic.
They cannot use psionics, do not have thief abilities and do not
brew poisons. So what is their strength?
<P>
It is the raw knowledge of the way nature works. It's about evolution,
about DNA and about life creation. The process of linking different
DNA patterns together andmolecular fusion are all very hard and
demand long study and much experience.
<P>
The Standard Nature-Master has wizard Thac0, rogue hit points
and saving throws, does not wear armor, uses wizard weaponry,
rouge magical items (no scrolls), gains 2 hp per level after 9,
and has no other special abilities past the creation of Living
Items. The Nature-Master is a very demanding class; a nature-master
cannot be multi-classed. Nature-Masters progress in level as inidcated
on the table. On this table the NM-check is also given. This check
indicates the Nature-Masters increasing ability to create living
items. The Nature-Master rolls a d100 every time he wishes to
create a living item. When below this chance of succes (modified
by several factors, see below) he succeed in researching the item.

<P>
<I>The story of the War with Dregoth is remembered by many, but
little know of the other war that was fought out at the same time.
A strange creature, a blob of shapeshifting grey matter found
freedom after more than 20,000 years of imprisonment. This Shapshifter
started ravaging about the land, killing people everywere.</I>
<P>
<I>Then The Wanderer came. Instead of only his arm, his whole
uper torso was covered with lizard skin. The creature attacked
the Wanderer on sight, and in the end, the Wanderer was victorious,
apparently not even harmed. Nobody knows what would have happened
if the creature had not been stopped, except for the ancient halflings
of Thamasku. They still tell the story about the battle, and about
their visions of what would have happened. The claim the grey
monster would have fused with Dregoth, and the two togehter slaughtering
all the ancient city-states. And somehow, what they say seems
to be right&#133;</I>
<P>
Nature-Masters who advance beyond 20st level gain tremendous powers.
Slowly, they transform into a new being, a <I>Shapeshifter</I>.
The Nature-Master becomes a sort of living weapon himself, gaining
the ability to fuse with other living items, and the ability to
shapechange into any form desired.
<P>
Nature-Masters who want to become 21st level should first accumulate
the neccesary experience points. When the experience is gathered,
they can begin the transformation. The Nature-Master has to alter
his DNA so that it can fuse with a blob of grey, living material.
This material can only be created by nature-masters of 20st level
or higher and takes 1 full year to create.
<P>
The Nature-Master then has to find a place where he is absolutely
secure, for he will then need to fuse with the material during
a slow metamorphosis which takes a full week. After this, the
nature-master gains many powerful abilities:
<UL>
<LI><B>21st level Shapechanger:</B> The nature-master fuses with
the grey blob, and his body metabolism changes so that he can
survive by consuming 2000 kilojoules a month, be it by sunlight,
food, or another source. This effectivily means the Shapechanger
does not have to eat or drink.<BR>
The Shapechanger still retains his original appeareance, but one
of his hands or feet is transformed into something else. He can
make this appendace assume any form he wants to, and any material,
as long as the volume stays the same. So a hand could be transformed
into a wrist razor, short sword, shield, lasso, pole, thieves
pick, etc.<BR>
The Shapechanger gains 3d8 extra hit dice and his THAC0 changes
to 10.<BR>
The Shapechanger also does no longer need money or assistance
for the creation of living items and there is no danger for him
to loose control of a intelligent living item.
<LI><B>22nd level Shapechanger:</B> The Shapechanger's form changes
further, for know not one hand or foot, but both are changed into
shapechanging material. THAC0 remains 10, and the nature-master
gains 1d8 extra hp.
<LI><B>23rd level Shapechanger:</B> The Shapechanger's entire
arms or legs are know transformed into shapechangeable material,
and the Shapechanger can now temporarily attach another living
item to his own body. He can do this once every week, and for
1d6+6 hours. All the abilities of the living item are transferred
to the Shapechanger, so if an item is unaffected by lightning,
neither is the shapechanger.<BR>
THAC0 remains 10, another 1d8 hp is gained.
<LI><B>24th level Shapechanger:</B> The Shapechanger gains the
ability to discharge energy in his body into a crackling bolt
of lightning, up to 100' long, which causes 2d10+2 damage. He
can do this once a day. The Shapechanger's hair falls out. He
gains another 1d8 hp. THAC0 drops to 9.
<LI><B>25th level Shapechanger</B>: The Shapechanger's torso also
changes into changable material, leaving only his head normal.
His head becomes longer, however, and his skin turns grey, as
do his eyes.<BR>
The Shapechanger becomes immune to electricity attacks. THAC0
drops to 8, and 1d8 hp is gained. Electricial discharge does 3d10+4
dam.
<LI><B>26th level Shapechanger:</B> The Shapechanger now has complete
control over his body, being capable of assuming ANY form, coloring
or size (but with the same volume) he wants to. His sense of touch,
taste, smell and hearing all become much better as it was, and
he gains the ability to see perfectly, even in total darkness.
<BR>
THAC0 drops to 7 (lowest possible), and the Shapechanger gains
2 hp. Electricial Attack does 4d10+6 damage.<BR>

<LI><B>27th level Shapechanger:</B> The Shapechanger now regenerates
1 hp a round, does not require sleep or food anymore and his natural
AC drops to 7. Gains 2 hp. Electricial attack does 5d10+10 damage
(maximum.) The Shapechanger can now not only assume any form,
but also any material he wants to. (so he could change into rock,
wood, anything.) 10% Magic Resistance.
<LI><B>28th level Shapechanger:</B> The Shapechanger's mass can
be adjusted 100% upwards, or 50% downwards. Gains 2 hp. AC drops
to 5. 3 Electricial attacks a day. 25% Magic Resistance.
<LI><B>29th level Shapechanger:</B> Volume as big as an elephant,
as small as a cat. Gains 2 hp. AC drops to 3. 40% magical resistance.
<LI><B>30th level Shapechanger:</B> This final stage of metamorphosis
allows the Shapechanger to half the creation time for living items,
makes the Shapechanger unaffected by time, makes the Shapechanger
regenerate 2 hp a round, AC drops to 0, gains 2 hp, 50% magic
resistance. The Shapechanger can now adjust his body so he can
survive in any non-magical circomstances. He can fly like a Aarakocra,
survive in flames by turning to stone, and create just about any
living item he wants to.<BR>

</UL>

<H2>Chapter 7:</H2>

<H1>Creating Living Items</H1>

<P>
Creating a living item is as hard as creating a magical item and
takes as much (or more!) time. The creation of a living item requires
long study and many experiments. Once a Nature-Master knows how
to create aliving item he can create the same item again relatively
simple.
<P>
The living items can be divided into 2 cateogries: long lived
and short-lived. Short-lived items are much easier to create and
take less time. In these two categories, the items can be defined
in xp value. The more powerful the item, the more xp the nature-master
gets from making it.
<P>
When a player wishes to create a living item, he tells the DM
of it and tells the DM what he wants the item to do. The DM tells
the player what he doesn't like and player and DM 'bargain' about
the item. When both are satisfied, the DM determines the tissue
samples the player requires for the item. For a walking chair,
he could ask for the root of a Tree of Life, polishing wax created
with the juice from a rare fruit, or anything he can think of.
The player needs to provide these components.
<P>
The player then begins researching. The process of researching
costs 3d100 cp per month, and takes 1d6 months per sample needed.
When the player is done, he has to succeed at a nature-master
check, with a -5 penatly for every tissue needed, and a -1 penalty
for every 10,000 qubic feet. An additional penalty of -1 for every
year the item should live (maximum of -500 for an immortal item)
is also applied. If this fails, he can then make another check,
with a cumulative +5 bonus, every week, with the cost of an additional
1d100x10 cp a week.
<P>
You should note the Nature-Master CANNOT create an item which
would reduce his base chance of succes below zero.
<P>
When the research is done, the item has to be 'grown.' For small
items, this has to be done in a laboratory, similar to that of
a wizard. This growing takes 1d4 weeks per qubic foot of the item
(an item 1' x 1' takes 1d4 weeks, an item 2' x 2' 2d4, etc.),
costs 1d20 cp per week, and requires the nature-masters full attention
(he can eat and sleep, but cannot go out to adventure.) When this
is done, the Nature-Master rolls a d100. On a 1,2 or 3, the growing
process has gone wrong and the item has to be grown again. On
a 98,99 or 00, the item has got some other property the nature
master didn't plan (good or bad, DMs descretion.)
<P>
For items to large to fit into the nature-masters laboratory,
a special building space must be created. The cost for this building
place is 500 cp per 100 square feet, so if the nature-master wants
to create a building 500 feet on a side, the cost is 12,500 cp.
<P>
The growing of such a large item takes 1d4 months per 20,000 qubic
feet, meaning a 500' x 500' x 20 building would take 25d4 months
to grow. The cost for growing such an item is measured in crew
needed to supervise: one aprentice per 100,000 qubic feet, with
the average payment for an aprentice being around 50 cp a month.
(a Nature-Master only needs to check on the item once every month.)
<P>
Clearly, constructing large buildings takes years.
<P>
<I>Maring the Nature-Master wishes to create a living castle.
He has determined the castle will be 200x200x20 feet, which is
40000 square feet and 800000 qubic feet. He tells the DM he wishes
the castle to be able to filter water from the air, supplying
200 gallons of water a day. Also it should be able to withstand
sandstorms and non-magical fire.</I>
<P>
<I>The DM sees the castle as very hard to construct. He asks the
player what kind of openings, defenses to attacks and other properties
the castle should have. The player wants the castle gate to only
open when the player places his hand on the gate, that the castle
should have 5000 hit points and will not allow any non-humanoids
to enter.</I>
<P>
<I>The DM wants the player to find the essence of obsidian, the
tears of a rain drake, the hair of the camel-subspecies called
'nereth' (only found in the Endless Sand Dunes), and a piece of
papyrus (to confuse the player.)</I>
<P>
<I>The player somehow accumulates these materials, and starts
his research. This takes 4d6 months and costs the player 12d100
cp. Maring has a -20 penalty for tissues, and a -80 penalty for
size. Marings nature-master check is 100, meaning his chance of
succes is 0% (this item is all Maring can manage right know).
After one week, this is 5%, with a 5% cumulative bonus every week,
so after 20 extra weeks his chance of succes is 100%.</I>
<P>
<I>Maring, after 8 weeks and another 8d100x10 cp, is ready to
begin growing the castle. First, he has to prepare the building
site. This costs him 2000 cp. Then, the castle has to be grown.
Maring has to find 8 aprentices at a cost of 50 cp a month. This
will take Maring 40d4 months, or about 7(!) years. After seven
years, and about 400000(!) cp, the castle is finally finished.
Maring has spent 7 years of his life and 12d100+8d100x10+2000+40.000
cp, the castle is finished. Maring rolls a d100 and rolls 00 (Yes!
Yes!) The DM decides the Castle has 3000 hp and is also immune
to magical fire.</I>
<P>
Many will say that this takes very long and is unfair. Well, in
the above example, the castle was <I>massive</I>. Maring could
also have built a wall in a square, 800' x 10' x 10', which is
80,000 qubic feet, with a donjon in the middle, 60' x 40' x 40'
(96,000 qubic feet), which would also be a very good castle, which
would take 80,000+96,000=176,000:20,000= 8,8 = 9d4 months, or
1 to 3 years. (still takes very long, I know.)
<P>
The trick to all this is cutting on cost. One could create a living
item to supervise the growing of the castle, create a series of
castles after each other, or use the DNA of an existing castle.
Also, you should remember that Nature-Masters are intended as
NPCs, who have the time for such projects, and aren't in a hurry
to get past level 20.
<H3>Intelligent Items</H3>

<P>
A Nature-Master can create living items starting at 9th level.
The maximum intelligence of the item is equal to the casters level.
Intelligent items can be thought psionic powers the nature-master
knows (he has to be wild talent or force user) as appropiate (telepathy
could be allowed, ultrablast not. A intelligent living item with
psionics should abide by all the restricitions regarding psionic
item creation.)
<P>
Intelligent Items are always aligned. The Nature-Master determines
the alignment he wants the item to have and rolls on the following
table:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
<B>d100 roll</B>      Alignment:            

01, 02         Lawful                

03, 04, 05     Chaotic               

06, 07         Neutral               

08-92          as intended           

93, 94         Neutral               

95,96,97       Evil                  

98,99          Good                  

00             violent chaotic       
               neutral               


</PRE>

<P>
The Creation of Intelligent Items is much harder than for other
items. Growing Time is doubled for normal-sized items, and tripled
for giant sized items. The nature-master also recieves a -25 penalty
to his NM-check.
<P>
Ego for intelligent living items is equal to intelligence +1 one,
and a Chaotic Neutral item gains a +5 bonus. There also is a +1
bonus per special power (protection from elements, lightning discharge,
etc.)
<H3>XP Value for items</H3>

<P>
The experience award gained for the creation of a living item
is easily determined, by multiplying the item'' Nature-Master
Check penatly by 250. For example, in the above example, the castle
caused a -100 penalty to the NM-chk. This means 100x100=25.000
xp. This includes finding the tissue samples, the research and
the growing, but does not include any experience Maring could
have got by scaring of the giants that were about to attack him,
or the xp he got for defeating a Rain Drake&#133;
<H2>Creating a Race</H2>

<P>
Starting at 13th level, a Nature-Master can cross-breed races,
creating a new one in the process. He does this by taking DNA
from two or more species and mixing them into what he wants. He
could try to cross a human with a halfling (creating a &#190;ling,
or something), a human with a horse (athasian centaur), or go
on the weird and cross a flee with a giant (waaaahhhh!!)
<P>
Obviously, this is very difficult. Crossing a human with a halfling
might be possible, but crossing a human with a silt horror or
something is a big problem.
<P>
The basics for creating a race is simple: the Nature-Master takes
the sperm and egg-cells (or other means of reproduction) of the
desired races, and fuses them by using special combinations of
powders, oils, ointments and other strange stuff.
<P>
For crossing a human with a halfling, maybe a phylter of etherealness
is required. For crossing a giant with a flee, the DM could demand
blood from a maiden, just drunken by a Vampire in the Mists of
Ravenloft&#133;or something really hard to get.
<P>
When the Nature-Master has these components (DMs could demand
several, or impossible ones if he does not like the idea of this
new race on Athas), he needs the sperm and egg samples. This could
be very hard (yeah, you need to convince this Giant to give you
a sample&#133;)
<P>
After this, all should be put in a sterile environment, and grown.
The time this takes depends on the chosen races (crossing two
types of bacteria takes a few minutes, while human and halfling
take about 9 months.) This breeding demands constant attention
of the Nature-Master, and he cannot be involved in any other activities.
<P>
When the new creature is grown, the nature-master rolls a d100,
and checks on the accompanying table. The roll is modified upwards
by the nature-masters level, and downwards for the following:
<UL>
<LI>+10 if cross-breeding a human with something else
<LI>-10 per size difference between the species (crossing S and
M creatures means a -10 penatly);
<LI>-25 for creatures of different types (reptile vs mammal, bird
vs amphibian, etc.)
<LI>+40 to -40 penalty on DMs descretion.
</UL>

<PRE WIDTH=132>

</PRE>

<P>
For example, Maring wishes to cross a human with a snake. He is
now 14th level. The modifiers are: +10 for human, -25 for reptile
and mammal, and -20 because the DM feels a human and a snake have
radically different structures.
<P>
Maring rolls a d100, and rolls 65, for a modified total of 44
(65+14+10-25-20=44.) He succeeds, and creates a creature somewhat
like a Yuan-Ti. These rules leave many gaps open (for example,
how many creatures do you need to start a new race), which each
DM should fill in. Use you common sense.
<H2>Chapter 8:</H2>

<H1>Living Items</H1>

<P>
The living items here are devided into 8 distinct categories:
<OL>
<LI>Living Weapons
<LI>Intelligent Weapons
<LI>Intelligent Items
<LI>Body-Attachments
<LI>Mortal Living Items
<LI>Immortal Living Items
<LI>Living Artifacts
<LI>Plant-Based Living Items
</OL>

<H2>Living Weapons</H2>

<P>
Examples of living weapons are daggers that are poisonous, flying
arrows, etc.
<H4>Biting Dagger</H4>

<P>
This item feeds on human blood. It is an ordinary throwing dagger,
but when it hits a victim, it opens it's yaws and bites itself
into the victim. It sucks the blood from the victim for 3 rounds,
after wich it is full. This does 1d6 damage per round. It takes
a succesful strength check to pull the dagger loose, but this
does 1d4 damage.
<P>
Biting Daggers need 1 round of blood-sucking a day, and only target
creatures that are still alive. The average life-span of a biting
dagger is 20 years.
<H4>Whip of constircition</H4>

<P>
This whip, made from a combination of leather,twines and snake-hide,
has a very useful property. When one hits an enemy with a natural
18 or higher, the whip entangles the victim. This does no damage,
but a succesful open doors check at -4 is required to break the
hold.
<P>
The whip is semi-intelligent, for it acts like a snake and eats
mouses, rabbits and other small prey. It has to be fed at least
once a week, and needs a minimum of 3 mouse-sized animals to survive.
<H4>Attached Wrist Razor</H4>

<P>
This is a Wrist Razor that attaches itself to the wielders arm,
at the elbow. It can be folded so it is used as a buckler (hand
usable for everything), or as a wrist razor (not usable for anything
else.)
<P>
The Wrist Razor feeds by injecting small needles into the wearer's
skin, and comsuming small amounts of energy from his blood (the
amounts consumed are so little the wearer does not notice.)
<P>
The advantage of the wrist razor, besides not dropping you weapon,
is that it enhances the wielder's strength in his arm. By injecting
small amounts of (natural) fluid, it makes the strength of the
wielders arm 18 (will not cause strength to drop.) This effectivily
means damage bonus of 18 strength, and a strength of &quot;normal
strength+18:2&quot; in the arms.
<H4>Nail Stings</H4>

<P>
These consist of a total of 10 wormlike creatures, that eat theirselves
a way to the &quot;vicitm's&quot; nails, starting at the elbow.
When here, the hand will not be usable for 2 weeks. But when the
wounds are healed, the wearer will be able to eject and retract
1 inch long claws from below his nails, making his hands weapons
with Fa speed, dam 1d6/1d4 and knockdown 1d4.
<H2>Intelligent Weapons</H2>

<P>
These weapons are actually creatures, with full Intellect, reasoning
ability, alignment, combat description, etcetera. They cna have
numerous abilities, perhaps even character classes. However, most
of them have some similar abilities:
<UL>
<LI>the ability to change shape.
<LI>the ability to form weapons from their bodies (hammers, swords,
fists.)
<LI>the ability to discharge energy in an electricial blast, doing
around 1d8 to 10d8 damage.
<LI>at least low intelligence.
<LI>the will to fuse with another creature (of a particular race.)
<LI>te ability to learn, becoming more dangerous, more intelligent
and more powerful.
</UL>

<P>
You remember the lving weapon from Mystery of the Ancients:
<P>
<B>Living Weapon/Poog:</B> Int High (13); AL CE; AC 4; MV 6; HD
9; HP 47; THAC0 11; #AT 1 (can't use attack form more than twice
in succesive rounds); Dmg 1d10 (hammer fist) or 1d8 (sword limb)
or 1d6 (spike limb) or 3d6 (lightning bolt); SZ S (4 feet tall);
ML Champion (18); MAC 7; XP 2,000.
<P>
I have based other Living Weapons on this one. They are fairly
easy to create: think up which nature-bender created it, for what
reason, what the level of this nature-master was (and thus, power
of the item), the amount of information it has gained (and thus,
intelligence and power), and if the living item has a special
purpose.
<P>
I'm going to run an adventure with a group of 3rd to 7th level
PCs, who will have the task to fight this living item:
<H4>The Horror of Nibenay</H4>

<P>
This very powerful living item was given the task of destroying
the city of Nibenay, by whatever means possible. The Nature-Masters
of Nibenay discovered the item in time, and locked it up far beneath
the ground.
<P>
The purpose of this living item is the destruction of the city.
It plans to do this by fusing with one of the leaders of the city,
and beginning a civil war between two camps in the city. (it does
not know the nature-masters have died, and the city is ruled by
the Shadow King.)
<P>
INT 16; AL CE; AC 2; MV 12; HD 15; HP 82; THAC 0 5; #AT 2; Dmg
1d12+6 (large hammer fist)/3d6 (<I>lightning bolt</I>); SZ M (5
feet diameter sphere); ML 16; SA: the item is capable of assuming
the form of a human or other species of the same size. This can
be any individual, and it can imitate the looks of any creature
it sees. The item is likely to be found in the form of an important
person, usually with a very high charisma; XP 10,000
<H2>Intelligent Items</H2>

<P>
These are items that usually have very low intelligence, are unable
to learn and do not have damaging capabilities.
<H4>Walking Chair</H4>

<P>
This is a chair with ears. It can be told commands (in any language),
like: move here, stand still, seat up, seat down, etc. It feeds
upon the warmth of those who sit upon it, extracting the heat
from the body. This means the chair is also very refreshing to
sit in.
<H4>Walking Wagon</H4>

<P>
This vehicle has the form of a, simple, 5x8 feet open wagon. Instead
of weels, it has, big strong paws, which enable it to move with
a MR of 15, for 24 hours a day. It can be given simple commands
(any language, like: full speed ahead, stop, move left, sit, etc.)
<P>
The wagon has a capacity of 2,500 lbs maximum. It takes 40 points
of damage to destroy the wagon. It has to be fed with meat/plants
and water (making it expensive movement, for the wagon requires
as much food as 5 inixes.)
<H4>Rolling Carpet</H4>

<P>
This luxery item is a 4x8 ft. carpet, which moves itself by rolling
up one side, and rolling out the other one. It can obey simple
commands (in any language), like: forward, backward, stop, turn
left, right. The maximum movement rate of the carpet is 12. The
purpose of this carpet is to have it below your feet wherever
you go. It has to be fed small amounts of goldpieces: 1 gp a month.
The carpet also floats on water or silt, making it a way to cross
the Silt Sea.
<H2>Body-Attachments</H2>

<P>
This category is for those items that attach themselves to the
wearer. Examples are: body armor, clothing, tools, ropes, etc.
<H4>Flesh Armor</H4>

<P>
This is a complete suit of &quot;plate mail&quot;, where the plates
are replaced by flesh. This flesh absorbs 50% of the damage done
to the wearer. The wearer can't use armor in combination with
this item.
<P>
The flesh armor cannot whithstand 100 or more damge at a time,
and has a total of 500 hp. It regains hit points at a rate of
1 per 6 hours, when well-feeded. The Armor feeds on blood, in
which the wearer must bathe once a week.
<P>
The armor is created from the remains of dead corpes, of various
(humanoid) races.
<H4>Silt Stilts</H4>

<P>
This set of stilts is used for crossing the Silt sea. They attach
themselves to the user's feet, and the user gains the ability
to sense with the stilts like they were part of his own legs,
enabling him to walk at his normal movement rate and feeling the
ground below the silt (he'll know on time when he has hit the
edge of the underground wall.)
<P>
Like many other body-attachments, it drains the wearer for food.
<H2>Mortal Living Items</H2>

<P>
Into this category fall normal-use items that have a limited lifetime.
These items are of little interest to adventurers, but they include
such things as musical imstruments, balloons and other items.
<H2>Immortal Living Items</H2>

<P>
Immortal Living Items are those common-use items that are normally
valuable and long lasting, like houses. Most of these, however,
are created using the plant weeds used for plant-based living
items.
<H2>Living Artifacts</H2>

<P>
These are the few very powerful items that are created by the
combined efforts of many of the powerful ancient nature-masters
and nature-benders. The process for creating such powerful items
as these is different from that for normal living items, and the
knowledge how to make the items had been lost.
<H2>Plant-based Living Items</H2>

<P>
The last category is not one of true living items, but a description
of a very strange plant. The ancient nature-masters first did
not create these living items, but they grew houses and tools
in another way: in the seas, there was a strange seaweed, that
lived in symbiosis with an even stranger mould. These plants grew
into strange shapes, until they somehow changed into stone.
<P>
The nature-masters found out they could manipulate the symbiotic
life form by controlling the amount of mould against the amount
of plant. They learned how to shape the plants into many different
forms. At first, they created simple iglo's of plant, letting
them change into the strange stone-like material. They learned
how to create more massive structures, eventually creating whole
cities.
<P>
This type of item was the most common one in the Blue Age, but
now, the life-form only exists in the lake of Thamasku, and the
only ones that build structures like this are the halflings of
Thamasku.
