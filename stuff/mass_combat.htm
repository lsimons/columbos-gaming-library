<P>
Now, these rules are for those who do not know about the battlesystem
rules or find them too complicated and slow to use. They present
a fast, good way of solving combat between armies. You should
note it is assumed that you have access to the Players' Option:
Combat and Tactics book.
<P>
The main advantage of the system below is that it is fast, while
staying realistic, too. The main disadvantage perhaps is that
the effect of chance is nullified (while you can also  see that
as an advantage), and that the preparation of army lists takes
long.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc413124651">Army Lists</A></H2>

<P>
You need to create the lists of the armies involved. Depending
on size, the armies are measured in units (100 humans, or 100
squares in melee scale), or stands (10 humans, or 10 squares in
melee scale.) Each unit or stand gets a miniature accompanying
it. Note that a unit is equal to what can fit in a 100 square
area (combat system melee scale), this means 100 medium sized
creatures, but only one dragon. A stand is equal to what can fit
in a 10 square area, which is 10 men, but only 5 giants.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001930">Statistics</A></H3>

<P>
Each Mass Combat unit has only a few statistics, which are all
you need for playing battles. Below is a form showing all possible
statistics.

Description                          <I>Cost:</I>     


</PRE>

<P>
<B>TROOP NAME:</B> in this field, there's a descriptional name
for the unit. For example &quot;Human Crossbowmen&quot;.
<UL>
<LI><B>ATT: </B>The attack score specifies how much damage a unit
does in melee combat in one round. A 10 is a low score, while
a 20 is high. Rules for calculating the ATTack score, and the
other scores, are at the end of this chapter.
<LI><B>MISSILE:</B> This score indicates how much damage a unit
does in missile combat in one round.
<LI><B>DEF: </B>This score indicates the damage the unit can take
before being incacpated. This number varies greatly for different
troop types.
<LI><B>MV:</B> This score is the number of squares the unit may
move in one round.
<LI><B>ML:</B> This score indicates gives an indication on how
good a unit its morale is. A 1 is the lowest, a 20 the highest.
<LI><B>SPECIAL: </B>In this section, information is given about
special abilities troops may have. The exact abilities are described
below.
<LI><B>DESCRIPTION:</B> A guideline how common troops of this
type are armored.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc413124652">Special Abilities</A></H3>

<P>
Below is a description of the most common special abilities units
may have. Others can exist, too, but descriptions for these are
given for individual units.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001932">Fearless</A></H4>

<P>
Creatures with a morale of fearless (20), and mindless creatures
have this ability. They <I>do not check morale</I> and are <I>immune
to cause panic</I>. Skeletons and other mindless Undead are examples
of creatures with this ability.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001933">Cause Panic</A></H4>

<P>
Several units have this special ability. <I>When a unit is hit
by these for the first time in combat, it needs to make a morale
check</I>. <I>If it passes, no further cause panic morale checks
need to be rolled in this battle for this unit</I>. If it fails,
it flees from battle.
<P>
Units with this ability include all Undead, all magical dangerous
creatures (wyvern cavalry), and perhaps also armies that have
a special reputation (some dragon knights, the Black Faction.)
Also, charging units of heavy cavalry often have a &quot;Cause
Panic when Charge&quot; ability - when characters are charged
by heavy knights mounted on warhorses, many soldiers turn and
run.
<P>
<I>If there is a modifier listed (positive or negative), add this
to the morale check</I> (cause panic -2 means a -2 penalty to
morale.)
<P>
<I>A unit which causes panic itself is immune to cause panic effects
of others</I>.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001934">Fight Disorderly</A></H4>

<P>
These units are made up of creatures that are not trained for
combat or do not fight well in units. Examples are militia and
many monstrous species, like lizard men. These units, <I>when
charged by mounted characters, overrun, attacked by warmachines,
or attacked by area-effect spells have to roll 1d6. If the roll
is above the number listed, the unit breaks apart</I> (creatures
are considered to move away from the battle scene.)
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001935">Ranged Attack</A></H4>

<P>
When a unit uses a attack, you should use the range under &quot;special.&quot;
So long bow archers use the attack rating in parenthesis (for
example: 16 (36 missile)/ 60) when firing missiles, and use the
range under special (Special: range 34)
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001936">Mounted Characters</A></H4>

<P>
The advantage of mounts in combat is the ability to strike from
a higher position; attackers are &quot;on higher ground&quot;
when attacking from a horse, as such, he receives a +1 bonus to
the attack score. In addition, mounted characters have the advantage
of higher movement most of the time. These bonuses have been taken
into consideration in the army lists at the end of this book.
<P>
Remember, unmounted characters that attack mounted characters
have a -1 penalty to their Att score, and archers attacking from
horseback can still move. When using a half-move, they have a
-2 penalty to their Att score, and while using a full-move, this
is a -4 penalty.
<P>
See the additional notes on mounts later on as well.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001937">Rate Of Fire</A></H4>

<P>
Some units may have a ROF listed. If so, <I>they can attack only
once in a few rounds</I>. For example ROF &#188; means there can
only be an attack once every 4 rounds.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001938">Overruns</A></H4>

<P>
Usually, knockdowns are not used. When a unit has an overrun ability,
however, it can be very damaging. Instead of rolling knockdown,<I>
a stand attacked by a stand with overrun ability cannot attack
the next round</I>. For example, a unit of light infantry attacked
by a light chariot unit using overrun cannot attack the next round.
(though they can attack the round they were overrun.)
<P>
Stands consisting of huge or gargantuan creatures (only) are considered
to have an overrun ability, as do creatures that have a d20 knockdown
die, as do chariots and wagons.
<P>
Overruns often come with some additional stats:
<P>
Overrun vs <I>#of units/stands</I> - Att <I>#</I>
<P>
# of units/stands indicates the number of units this unit can
attack this way. If there are multiple units, those that are behind
the first, in the bath of the unit that uses overrun, are also
attacked. Place the unit that has used overrun in the place of
the last unit they attacked, and place this unit in front of them.
The attack score that is listed here <I>replaces</I> the normal
attack score of the unit.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001939">Attack First</A></H4>

<P>
Units with this ability either have an initiative of Very Fast
or make use of (ranged) melee weapons like polearms<I>. A unit
with this ability attacks in step 2: missile combat, instead of
during step 4</I>.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001940">Attack Last</A></H4>

<P>
Some creatures are very slow, attacking last in every round. <I>These
creatures resolve their attacks during the end of round resolution</I>.
An example of such a creature is the zombie. Creatures with a
natural initiative of very slow (gargantuan creatures) are also
considered to have this disability.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001941">Area Attacks</A></H4>

<P>
Some stands or units may have the ability to attack using a ranged
attack (like a breath weapon.) An area attack gives the area effected
in units, as well as an attack rating (for example:
<P>
area attack (fire breath, cone) 5 att 40)
<P>
The attack here is a fire breath weapon effecting 5 units. Which
stands are affected is determined by the cone mentioning. Other
possibilities are radius, line, square.
<P>
The attack rating for an area attack is found by finding maximum
damage, and dividing this by 10 for units, or 0 for stands. For
example, a breath weapon that does 3d6 damage has an attack rating
of (3x6=)18, which it does against several stands.
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001942">Optional Rule: Leadership</A></H4>

<HR>

<P>
You can give a character a <I>command radius</I>. This radius
determines how far his leadership goes. (how much men he can command
in battle.) He simply is unable to command larger forces.
<P>
This command radius depends on class and level: it is a base radius
of &#189; unit per level for fighters, and &#188; unit per level
for other classes. This means a 9th level fighter can command
units up to 5 (4.5 rounded up) squares away in unit scale, or
up to 45 squares in stand scale. (which would mean around 2500
men, a considerable army.)
<HR>

<P>
Those that are beyond this range cannot operate together with
the army and operate individually. (if these units also have leaders,
they can still join in combat, ruled by these leaders. If they
don't have rulers (a rare situation), their formation breaks and
the unit is considered dead for the rest of the combat.)
<P>
If you use this, there should also be <I>a command radius proficiency
</I>in the warrior group: at a cost of 2 CPs, a fighter can increase
his command radius as if he was one level higher. Additional CPs
can improve this further, up to a maximum of +5 levels.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc414001943">The Battlefield</A></H2>

<P>
The battle takes place using miniatures on a map. Each unit or
stand takes one square. In Unit Scale, a square is equal to 100
normal melee squares, which is a 10x10 block, or 50x50 feet. In
Stand Scale, a stand  takes one square. A square is equal to 10
normal squares, which is a 3 1/3x3 1/3 block, or about 15x15 feet.
For our purposes, we assume that stand scale is equal to missile
scale, and that missile ranges are divided by three when using
the unit scale.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc405195131">FACING</A></H5>

<P>
Does not apply. Since there are 10 or hundred men in a square,
they can attack different areas., and face different directions.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc405195132">RANGE</A></H5>

<P>
The normal melee range of weapons is different. A dagger can normally
reach 6* squares, or 30 yards. In Unit Scale, the range is divided
by 3. This means a long bow can fire 14* squares away. A simple
dagger is only of use against opponents in adjacent squares.
<P>
In Stand Scale, range is the same as in missile scale. This means
you could use a dagger against an opponent up to 6* squares away.
<P>
* You use the maximum range to calculate the distance the projectile
flies.
<P>
Melee weapons can only be used to target opponents in adjacent
squares.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc405195133">SWITCHING SCALE</A></H5>

<P>
Sometimes, you may need to switch scale between Unit, Stand or
Melee Scale. (for example, in a battle between two small armies,
where the PCs are also battling themselves against the leader
of the other army.)
<P>
One square in unit scale is 3x3 in stand scale
<P>
One square in stands scale is 3x3 in melee scale.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc405195135">COMBAT STATUS</A></H5>

<P>
This is not of importance for Mass Combat fights, and so is not
used.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc405195136">ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY</A></H5>

<P>
These still occur when one unit or stand ignores the other, though
a unit or stand can make only one such attack every round.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc405195137">MOVEMENT</A></H5>

<P>
While scale has changed in the Mass Combat system, the time scale
has also changed, so the movement rate is still one square per
movement rate point in both unit and stand scale.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc405195138">SURPRISE</A></H5>

<P>
This is usually not applicable: it is hard for an army of hundreds
of men to travel unnoticed. When it does, surprise is rolled for
each side, and not for each unit or stand, to save time.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc405195139">SET-UP</A></H5>

<P>
The last step to take before combat is the set-up. This will take
some time. The DM has to create the battle field, and all the
figures should be positioned. Unlike normally, the players can
decide the position of the army.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc413124656">The Mass Combat Round</A></H2>

<P>
In the standard AD&amp;D system, a round is one minute long. In
the combat and tactics system combat system, a round is 10-15
seconds. In the Mass Combat scale, one round is equal to 5-30
minutes. This replaces the normal time scale. (battles between
large armies often took an entire day, so if you wish, in unit
scale, make a round equal to an hour.)
<P>
Spell durations measured in rounds are still the same duration
(one Mass Combat Round equals one standard round.) While this
is not the most realistic, it is fair.
<P>
The Mass Combat round is different from the normal round:
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001945">Step One: Declaration</A></H3>

<P>
DM and players determine what both armies do. DMs do not announce
this, but secretly decide it, before the players tell what they're
planning to do.
<P>
In this new system, initiative is not used anymore. All melee
attacks are assumed to happen in the same phase. The same is true
for missile attacks, though missile attacks are resolved before
all others.
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001946">Optional Rule: Initiative</A></H4>

<HR>

<HR>

<P>
Each mass combat round, you roll 1d6. The side with the higher
roll gains initiative. The advantage of initiative is that you
may attack first. Optionally, you can also decide to remove the
casualties immediately. (this way, the side with the initiative
gains a serious advantage.)
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001947">Step Two: Missile Combat</A></H3>

<P>
During step two, missile combat is resolved. Archers that first
take a half-move before they shoot attack in the melee combat
phase, not in this phase.
<P>
To resolve missile combat, declare for each of your units that
wishes to shoot what their target is. You cannot shoot at single
characters within units, only at the units themselves. If the
unit is behind some sort of cover, take into account the modifiers
for cover.
<P>
Resolve all attacks from one side first. Do not remove any casualties
yet. Then, have the other side use its missile fire. Even units
that are considered dead can still fire. When missile combat is
complete, remove the casualties.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001948">Step Three: Movement</A></H3>

<P>
All movement takes place before melee attacks do. If there are
any attacks of opportunity, resolve them in this phase, too. Every
miniature moves at the same time: when one unit moves one square,
all other units can move one square, too.
<P>
This is impractical to manage, so just move one unit completely,
and then move one unit from the other army. Continue this way
until all units have moved.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001949">Step Four: Melee Combat</A></H3>

<P>
In this step, all melee attacks are resolved. All units are assumed
to attack simultaneously. You do not need to roll any dice to
determine hits, for with normal rules, you always hit. Simply
subtract the attacking unit its attack score from the defending
unit its defence score. When a unit its defence score reaches
0, the unit is dead.
<P>
It is more practical to first resolve all attacks from one side,
and leave casualties until the other side has also attacked. At
this time you should remove the dead units. Attacks of opportunity
can occur outside this step, for they are resolved at the instant
they are made (usually during the movement step).
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001950">Step Five: Magic and Psionics</A>
</H3>

<P>
The use of all spells, psionics and magical items should be solved
at this time. While this may not be fair, it is necessary for
simplicity.
<P>
When casting a spell, there is one thing you should keep in mind:
you cast the spell against a whole unit, not against a single
person. Spells that affect only a single target (magic missile,
finger of death) divide the damage they do normally (by 50 for
units, 5 for stands.)
<P>
Area of effect spells (like fireball) are somewhat more difficult.
A 10th level spellcaster that casts a fireball will affect quite
a few men. The total area of effect would be an area 110 yards
long, and 40 feet wide. In Unit Scale, this would mean an area
about 6 squares long and one wide. The fireball would do 10d6
damage to everybody in its area of effect. This means that 600
men would suffer 10d6 damage, which is 35 damage per unit, and
there are 6 units!
<P>
Clearly, the use of spells on the battlefield is very complicated,
and requires much calculation. It is very entertaining however,
to see a powerful wizard wipe out half the army with a few carefully
placed spells. If 10th level magic is allowed, it suddenly becomes
clear what the power of a dragon is!
<P>
Area of effect abilities, like dragon breath, should also be resolved
at this time.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001951">Step Six: Resolution</A></H3>

<P>
during this last period, the other things that need to be done
before combat ends are done. These include retreat, morale and
status. (fatigue is not used in the Mass Combat Rules.)
<P>
The first thing that should be resolved here are any attacks from
units with the attack last disability.
<P>
A retreat normally does not occur. A unit may force another to
retreat by not damaging them but drive them back. This means the
units Attack score is effectively 0, but the other unit is pushed
back. The defending unit can choose not to retreat, by pulling
its damage, too. If you wish a unit to use this action, you must
announce this before initiative.
<P>
Morale should be checked per unit. The normal morale rules apply.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc413124657">Possible Actions</A></H2>

<P>
Not all the options that are available to single characters are
available to entire units. Below is a description of the actions
a unit can take.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001953">Attack</A></H3>

<P>
You do not have to state which unit one of your units is going
to attack, just that you intend to do so. It makes no difference
if you need to move first before your attack. If you do, your
unit may move up to half its movement rate  in squares in the
movement step, and you attack in the melee combat step. If you
cannot attack in this way, you should use the charge option.
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001954">Optional Rule: Thac0</A></H4>

<HR>

<HR>

<P>
You can choose to use thac0. If you do so, don't give any modifier
to the attack score for Thac0. Then you roll the units' thac0
vs. AC 10. (most units will have a Thac0 of 20, so you do not
have to rework the army lists).
<HR>

<P>
Optionally, you can also choose not to use AC either(that requires
recalculation of all the defence ratings). If you do so, you should
roll Thac0 vs the normal AC, as per the standard rules.
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc414001955">Optional Rule: To-Hit-Rolling</A>
</H4>

<HR>

<HR>

<P>
Some of you might not want to bother with Thac0s, but still include
the effect of chance in play. Here is an easy way: for each attacking
unit, roll 1d6. If the roll is a 6, the attack fails. Note that
this slows play considerably.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001956">Missile Attack</A></H3>

<P>
A unit which uses a missile attack is considered not paying attention
to units in adjacent squares (except if it is firing at these
units.) Therefore, these units may gain attacks of opportunity
versus the shooting unit. Shooting units do not attack in melee
combat and cannot make any attacks of opportunity.
<P>
Units may opt to move up to half their movement rate and fire
after they do so. If you choose this, a unit fires in the melee
combat step.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001957">Move</A></H3>

<P>
Often, units have to close for combat first. If you move a unit,
it may simply move during the movement step, up to its movement
rate in squares. While moving units can make attacks of opportunity,
they cannot make melee attacks.
<P>
Unlike normal, a unit may not move through friendly units. If
it does, these units cannot do anything that round.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001958">Charge</A></H3>

<P>
When a unit charges, it moves up to 1.5 its movement rate in the
movement step, and attacks during the melee step. An attacking
unit gains a +2 bonus to its attack score for this round, and
a -10 to its defence score for this round. A unit that is charging
cannot make attacks of opportunity, and other units that it has
to pass can make these attacks against them.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001959">March</A></H3>

<P>
A unit that is marching moves with its weapons shouldered. Marching
units cannot make attacks of opportunity, while units that are
in adjacent squares can make attacks of opportunity on them. Therefore,
you should not use the march option unless there are no enemy
units closeby. A unit that marches may move up to twice its movement
rate.
<P>
A marching unit that is attacked has a -10 penalty to its defence
score. In addition, it takes double damage from spears and several
other weapons, like charging units do.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc414001960">Combat Modifiers</A></H2>

<P>
Many rules from combat and tactics also apply to mass combat.
But you cannot simply use the bonuses and penalties as they are
given (you don't even use THAC0s anymore, remember). Here is how
conversions are handled.
<OL>
<LI>a Thac0 bonus of +1 means a +1 bonus on the Attack value.
Similarly, a -1 penalty is a -1 penalty.
<LI>an AC bonus of -1 means a -1 penalty to the Attack Score of
the attacking unit. Similarly, an AC penalty of -1 means a -1
to their attack score. These modifiers can't be applied to the
defence score (think about it, and you'll know why).
<LI>a Damage bonus of +1 means a +2 bonus to the Attack Score,
and a -1 penalty means a -2 penalty.
</OL>

<P>
Using these rules, you should be able to determine any bonus or
penalty (common bonuses and penalties are given below).

Siege weapons can be very handy when fighting wars. A castle with
the ability to throw hot oil over attackers is much more dangerous,
and can kill off large amounts of attackers. Chapter 8 of Combat
and tactics details several siege engines.
<P>
Siege Engines follow many of the same rules normal armies do,
and their mass combat statistics are given below. You should note
that rules for sieges are not included for mass combat; these
can be found in combat and tactics, though some notes are given
below.
<P>
The table top left gives statistics for battle engines in mass
combat. Explanations are given below:
<P>
<B>Attack Rating  </B> is the rating for one of the devices. For
example, a single trebuchet can inflict 230 points of damage to
a single stand in one round (provided it can fire.) The given
rating is for stand scale, in missile scale, divide this by 10.
<P>
<B>Defence Rating</B>  is the attack damage required to destroy
a single war engine, including the crew.
<P>
<B>Spaces  </B> the number of spaces a single engine takes (stand
scale.) This includes crew, and sufficient firing space. For unit
scale, divide this by 10.
<P>
<B>ROF   </B> the rate of fire for the new combat round.
<P>
<B>Change Facing</B>  the number of rounds it requires to change
facing.
<P>
Three light catapults in stand scale would have the following
statistics:
<P>
<B>3 Light Catapults    141/54</B>
<P>
MV 0; ML 10; Special range 15-30, ROF 1/4.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001963">Sieges</A></H3>

<P>
Pages 165-175 of combat and tactics describe a quick system for
solving siege warfare. I suggest you use this system; it is quick,
gives a reflection of reality and can perfectly used with the
mass combat rules.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc414001964">How the scores are generated</A></H2>

<P>
Probably, you're going to design your own specific units, and
therefore, you will need to know how to generate the scores.
<P>
When generating the scores, work in the following way:
<UL>
<LI><B>Name of the unit:</B> you give a short descriptional name
for the unit.
<LI><B>Att: </B>This number combines the damage, THAC0, and number
of attacks. You need to figure out the <I>maximum damage all in
the group do together in one round</I> . This score is <I>divided
by 50 for units, or 5 for stands</I>. To this rating, add a <I>bonus
of 1 for every point of THAC0 below 20</I>.<BR>
Multiply this number by the number of attacks each round.<BR>
With missile fire, work in the same way, though you should remember
many weapons can be fired more than once in a round. 
<LI><B>Def:</B> This number combines hit points and Armor Class.
Figure out the <I>total (average) Hit Points</I> of the unit or
stand, and <I>divide this by 10 for units, or keep it for stands</I>.
To this number, you add a bonus that depends on armor class. This
bonus is equal to:<I> 100 minus (the average Armor Class times
ten).</I>
<LI><B>MV: </B>stands for movement. This is based on the lowest
(normal adnd rule) movement rate in the group.
<LI><B>ML: </B>stands for morale. This is based on the average
morale in the group.
<LI><B>Special: </B>here you give a short description of the special
abilities of the group. Run over each of the abilities, and consider
other special abilities. (though mentioning that units of elves
can detect secret doors is not necessary. Their +1 bonus with
swords and bows should be worked out in the standard ratings,
if they use them.)
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Lets consider the case of 2 elite stands of 3rd level. They're
all dwarves, using battleaxes and specialised in their use. In
addition, they have light crossbows. They wear chainmail, and
do not use shields. Try to re-calculate their statistics.
<PRE WIDTH=132>
<B>3rd lvl dwarven destroyers</B>         <B>38 (missile</B> 
                                       <B>30)/215</B> 

MV 6; ML 15; Special range 36, att 39 (miss   
31) vs goblin/orc, def 255 vs ogres, giants,  
gnolls, cause panic vs goblinoids             

These elite soldiers usually wear    <I>Cost:425</I>  
chain mail, and make use of                    
battleaxes and light crossbows. No             
shields.                                       


</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001965">Mounts</A></H3>

<P>
When riding mounts, it depends on how the mount is used whether
or not it is included in the statistics. For example, the heavy
cavalry use horses, but not to attack, but for movement. As such,
the mounts have no effect on mass combat statistics.
<P>
When a character rides a tyrannosaurus rex, it is assumed the
character does nothing but steer the mount, so statistics for
the mounts are used. When there is a combination (both mount and
rider attack), the statistics should be combined. When combining
the statistics, treat the unit as if it were two: the riders and
the mounts. When you are done, create the final statistics as
follows:
<P>
Attack: add both attack scores and divide this by 2. This is your
Att rating.
<P>
Defence: work in the same way as with the attack score.
<P>
Movement: of the mount (be sure to account for possible encumbrance
of the rider.)
<P>
Morale: use the morale score of the rider.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001966">War Machines</A></H3>

<P>
War machines are not very often employed in mass combat. When
this does happen, you may wish to create mass combat statistics
for them. Guidelines for the most common war machines are on page
4.
<P>
Chariots and wagons are usually used only to move characters,
and not as a method of attack. So when creating statistics for
these, the only advantages are movement, and possibly being on
higher ground or having cover.
<P>
The mass combat system does not include rules for sieges, use
rules from combat and tactics when solving castle siege (though
storming a castle can be played using these rules.)
<P>
Warfare is an exiting part of the Dragon Kings campaign. There
are many different options for solving these battles. You can
use the Battlesystem&reg; rules, the Mass Combat rules presented
here, a different mechanic (like Warhammer&trade;), or a custom
system.
<P>
Below are army lists that reflect the common troops for the World
of Drakin, with Mass Combat Stats included.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001967">High Level or Elite Units</A></H3>

<P>
For higher level soldiers, there are some modifiers thrown in.
First, remember THAC0 and hit points. Secondly, their are modifiers
like bonuses from specialisation (thac0, damage, # of attacks),
and other bonuses as well (extra attacks at real high levels,
higher morale, perhaps str or con bonuses&#133;)
<P>
When designing elite units, it is best to give the unit a special
ability that suits the race. For example, elite elven scouts perhaps
gain an &quot;automatic surprise&quot; ability, though they should
also get a stiff point penalty for this.
<P>
As a guideline, assume that fighters of level 3 or higher are
specialised, fighters of level 4 have exceptional strength, fighters
of level 5 have exceptional constitution, and add the fighter
his level to his morale.

<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001969">The Point System</A></H3>

<P>
Players can raise armies using a point-based system, with better,
more expensive troops costing more points. These points are also
an effective measure of a certain area's strength.
<P>
To calculate the number of points a unit costs, you use the following
mechanic:
<P>
<B>Attack Rating x5 + Missile Attack Rating + Defence Rating +
Movement + Morale</B>
<P>
For example, Light Footmen would cost
<P>
((16x5=)80+45+12+10=147 points. When calculating for stands, divide
by 10. Special abilities and equipment effect the score as shown
in the table below.

<P>
* this represents the extra training of the unit. In addition,
the mounts should be paid for. (see PHB for costs.)
<P>
@ use the att rating of the overrun if its higher than the normal
attack rating.
<P>
# this modifier is just a suggestion. Depending on the power of
the ability, it should be bigger or smaller.
<P>
For other, unlisted special abilities, use your own judgement.
As an option, instead of granting players a  number of followers,
you may wish to just give them points to spend on an army. For
every granted follower, give the player 2 points. This means that
instead of gaining 200 followers, a character gets 400 points.
He could choose 27 stands of light infantry, or 19 stands of light
cavalry.
<P>
For higher level followers (a fighter gains 1st level followers)
simply use the same system, but remember to add 50 points per
higher level unit. (though cost also increases 50 per higher level.)
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414001970">Generic Soldiers</A></H3>

<P>
These soldiers can be hirelings, or soldiers in service of nobles
and cities. They make up the bulk of the armies of the world.
<P>
All these assume 0th level soldiers. For every level, add 1 to
attack, 45 to defence and 50 to the cost.
