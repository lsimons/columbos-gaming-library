<P>
Before you start reading any of this:
<P>
ALL THIS IS THE OPINION OF JUST ONE DM!
<P>
I, as an experienced DM, have run several succesful custom-created
campaigns, and found that my own way was a good way of design
(it worked for me). There are many guides out there that tell
you how to create a world, how to create adventures, and most
of them give good advice.
<P>
I, as all DMs, have my own humble opinion on how you should write
a campaign, on how you should write an adventure, on how the ADND
game should be played. That is what this textfile is all about.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528063">Contents</A></H2>

<P>
This file will give you a step-by-step guide to creating your
own custom world. Starting DMs will find this most useful, and
advanced DMs will porbably find it easy for reference. Any player
who dares to read this will probably gain much more respect for
all those DMs out there.

<HR>

<P>
Below is a step-by-step plan on writing a fantasy roleplaying
campaign. As an example, I will use my latest campaign, the Dragon
Kings campaign setting (h<U>ttp://www.geocities.com/<BR>
TimesSquare/Arena/6180/index.html</U>).
<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528065">1. Purpose</A></H2>

<P>
Before you write anything down, consider a very important thing:
what are you going to use the world for? Think about these points:
<UL>
<LI><B>Scope:</B> If you plan to use the world for several years,
it should be expandable, and generally have a greater scope, compared
to a campaign in which you use will run just a few adventures.
<LI><B>Players:</B> If you're going to use the world with novice
players, it should be more conventional (typical fantasy) than
for experienced players.
<LI><B>Level:</B> A world written for low-level characters shouldn't
be too dangerous to travel, doesn't need details on church hierarchy,
government&#133;and so on. On the other hand, if you plan to run
30th level characters, it better have some powerful creatures
and gods, as well as oppurtunity for politics. This point will
affect many things (dangerous creatures, government, role of deities&#133;)
<LI><B>Other Goals:</B> Think of other things you want to accomplish
with the world. For example, if you want to use it with the Planescape
campaign, it will be different from a world that also ties to
Ravenloft.
</UL>

<P>
Go through all the points, think about them very well, and then
make the decisions. As you continue creating your world, keep
these things in mind continously.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc412528066">For the Novice</A></H4>

<OL>
<LI>Ask your gamers what kind of game they wish to play (which
level and general type of world)
<LI>larger area to define - less time for detail
<LI>more travelling - larger area to define
<LI>more magic - larger area to define (because of magical communication
and transport
<LI>more technology - larger area to define
<LI>higher levels - larger area to define
<LI>novice players/DM - take medieval Europe as an example (considering
technology and social system, that is)
<LI>don't even think of running a 15+ level campaign for now -
but you can keep the option open if you want to
<LI>don't bother about special goals - there not really necessary,
but are time-consuming
</OL>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc412528067">World of Drakin</A></H4>

<P>
<I>So, the example. This campaign, I decided, was ment to be used
for several campaigns, with several gaming groups. This ment the
world would have a vast scope, but that was my intention in the
first place.</I>
<P>
<I>I have long run campaigns with several experienced players,
and we agreed to run a high-level campaign (10+, perhaps godhood.)
I also wanted this world to be useful with my occasional group
of novice players. The level of the characters in the world should
be able to go all the way from 1 to +/- 30.</I>
<P>
<I>Then there was something else. From the beginning, I decided
that I would write everything on het world down, translate most
of it to english, and put it on the internet.</I>
<P>
<I>Overall, the world should be flexible.</I>
<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528068">2. Idea</A></H2>

<P>
Here is some of the fun stuff. This area requires your creativity.
Write down some of the ideas you have about your world. Note:
<UL>
<LI><B>Special:</B> What makes your world different from the typical
adnd campaign? What special ideas do you want to incorporate?
<LI><B>Atmosphere:</B> What is the nature of your world? Will
it be dark-gothic,<BR>
grim and realistic<BR>
oriental<BR>
historical<BR>
magic-infused?
<LI><B>Planets:</B> Are there any other inhabited plantes in the
solar system? Can the people from your primary world visit them?
What shape is your world like?
<LI><B>Geography:</B> What types of terrains do you want? Should
it be varied, or all wasteland? If so, why is this the case? Do
you need a large map, or not?
<LI><B>Races:</B> Are there any modifications to existing races?
How do the races live together? How do they differ from each other?
Which races are dominant? Will there be new PC races?
<LI><B>Creatures:</B> Think of how fantastic the world should
be. Will there be lots of dragons and fantastical creatures? Do
you need new creatures? Make sure you follow a logical food chain!
<LI><B>Gods:</B> How many gods are there? Where did they come
from? How do they interact with the world? What is their power
source? How do they work together (do they even talk)? Are they
good or evil or both?
<LI><B>Magic:</B> How common is magic? How do the people view
it? Are there any special rules or effects? Is it legal? What
is the highest level of magic attained? Will priest magic be more
powerful compared to wizard magic, or vise versa?
<LI><B>Technology:</B> What will be the level of advancement?
Will there be steam engines? Metal, bronze or only stone tools?
What is the realationship of technology to magic? Why is technology
so advanced (or not)?
<LI><B>Society:</B> Feudal, oriental, chaotic, monastic? Races
living apart or together? Why?
<LI><B>Many more point you can think of yourself</B>
</UL>

<P>
Now, when you have written all this down nice and orderly, put
it away and don't think about it for a few days. Then review your
notes again and change anything that is wrong. Does all this suit
your purpose? If not, <I>change it</I>.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc412528069">For the Novice</A></H4>

<P>
Work according to the following list:
<OL>
<LI>cosmology
<LI>geograhpy
<LI>climate
<LI>races
<LI>food-chain
<LI>gods, magic, technology
<LI>society, culture
<LI>anything else
</OL>

<P>
Some guides:
<UL>
<LI>use a feudal system
<LI>don't think about plane-hopping
<LI>don't think about multiple planets
<LI>humans are the dominant race
<LI>don't create new PC races
<LI>magic should not be too powerful (wish is maximum attainable)
<LI>technology equal to Europe in the period 700-1300 (that's
what ADND is written for)
<LI>preferably use a feudal system, or put a very powerful, beloved
king above everything else.
<LI>make sure everything makes sense with what you wrote down
before!
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="_Toc412528070">World of Drakin</A></H4>

<P>
<I>I wanted Drakin to have a feudal society, but with a different
touch, something to make high-level play interesting. Another
of my ideas was to give dragons a prominent place in society.
The last big modification to the typical adnd campaign should
be that there was a very powerful church, that was as powerful
as all the nations added together. There was going to be only
one god.</I>
<P>
<I>I worked out the points above as follows:</I>
<P>
<I>Planets: one inhabited planet, space travel not possible, no
crystal spheres or anything. The world will be flat, though that
shouldn't be clear to the players.</I>
<P>
<I>Geography: I wanted some detail, so my Known World would be
about 750.000 square miles (a managable area, if I put enough
effort in it)Climate should be temperate, for the MM just has
many monnsters for this climate, and because that would make the
world easier to visualise for my players.</I>
<P>
<I>Races: To have something to challenge experienced players,
there would have to be another, powerful, evil, warfaring race.
Other races should all be allowed as PCs. Perhaps a few more PC
races, to give something unique.</I>
<P>
<I>Creatures: I wanted to keep things typical adnd style as much
as I could here, for the dragons and new races would be hard enough
to adapt to. I like undead, so I decided there should be a little
more undead as normal (because of a connection to a ravenloft-like
world)</I>
<P>
<I>Gods: One of the main changes was that there would be only
one, all-powerful god. This God would not directly interact with
the world, but instead use avatars to further his causes (who
would be as powerful as the dragons.)</I>
<P>
<I>Magic: Here, I got another idea. The dragons would be transformed
arch-mages, giving me a good reason to hunt mages down. This ment
that magic would be rare and feared, but also powerful (afterall,
dragons are powerful creatures). Since priests should be much
more common, priestly magic would be, too.</I>
<P>
<I>Technology: The technology level had to be average to early
middle ages. However, I wanted a larger selection of more powerful
weapons. So I decided there had been periods in which magic and
psionics did not function, so people had to develop weapons to
survive. Besides, everyone had to survive the klingons&#133;</I>
<P>
<I>Society: From the above follows a basic feudal society, with
dragons and church at a higher level ruling over the nobles, and
the nobles unable to do anything against them. (except for the
players in the end, of course&#133;)</I>
<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528071">3. Work it Out</A></H2>

<P>
Now comes the hard part. You'll have to develop what you think
you're going to need during the first playing sessions (and more
if you feel adventurous.) There are several approaches to this,
but here is what I found out works best.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528072">Sketch</A></H3>

<P>
Make a quick sketch of your campaign area. This could be the entire
world (Dragonlance), a continent (Forgotten Realms), an area (Dark
Sun), a country (Mystara), or perhaps only a few villages and
towns (for beginners).
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528073">History</A></H3>

<P>
Start with your history. A detailed history will help shape the
world before your eyes, and gives a reason why person X rules
state Y. Important to mention are large, long wars, especially
between races. Depending on the scope of your world and your players'
interest in history, you need to develop more or less of your
history.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528074">Society</A></H3>

<P>
Once you have completed your history, look it over, and look at
your initial notes again. This will give you an idea of how the
culture should be like. Write down the basic stuff only; you can
work this part out later. It is only necessary to know the basics,
so you can define het rest.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528075">Geography</A></H3>

<P>
Work out the geography. If your campaign area should be small,
natural boundaries are an excellent excuse (think of ice, water,
mountains, desert, swamps, dangerous forests&#133;) Keep that
in mind. These can also work as logical explanations for different
cultures (i.e. if there is going to be both a western and an oriental
culture, be sure to put a large mountain range, sea, or something
between them.)
<P>
A good map is drawn as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Draw the big mountain ranges
<LI>Draw  the big water areas, and the rivers (remember, rivers
normally flow from  mountains to the sea)
<LI>Determine where the forests, swamps, and other terrain types
should be, taking the mountains and seas into account, as well
as climate.
<LI>Check for inconsistencies (desert next swamp and stuff)
<LI>Draw up the main map in detail.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528076">Nations</A></H3>

<P>
Before drawing nation borders, look over the following points
again:
<UL>
<LI>technology/magic (low technology means that very large empires
are impossible to maintain)
<LI>races (if orc are dominant, nations will be small)
<LI>geography (there often are natural borders between nations)
<LI>history (helps define why a nation lies there and how large
it should be)
<LI>all other information you have, of course (consistency is
the word throughout world creation)
<LI>your purpose with the world
</UL>

<P>
Below is an extensive list of points you can/should take in mind
when creating your nations. I found them on an internet page of
Rich Staats, who got the list from another source (?)
<UL>
<LI><B>Social system</B>
<LI><B>Racial groups</B>
<LI><B>Major NPCs</B>
<LI>Major religions
<LI>Major religious figures
<LI><B>Major laws</B>
<LI>Customs
<LI>Holidays
<LI>Style of clothing
<LI>General mindset
<LI>Educational system
<LI><B>Economic system</B>
<LI>Notable products or commodities
<LI>Major economic leaders
<LI>Major trading partners
<LI><B>Army: quality, tactics, equipment, technology(magic items?)</B>
<LI>Prevalence of magic
<LI>Legal status of magic
<LI>Magical institutions
<LI>Magical education
<LI><B>General attitude towards magic</B>
</UL>

<P>
<B>Note:</B> it isn't always necessary to detail all the nations.
Especially if your world is very large, you'll want to detail
the important nations only.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528077">Rules</A></H3>

<P>
Does your world need any new rules (for example, new races, new
classes)? If so, this is the point to write them down. It is important
that you also give all the necessary rules to your players, because
rules in adnd help a player interpret what happens.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528078">Other Stuff</A></H3>

<P>
There are hundreds of other details you will want to write up
about your world. Some things might be a calendar, monetary system,
noble banners&#133;you name it. Write these up after you're done
with the main stuff.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528079">Notes</A></H2>

<P>
The approach outlined above is one that is time-consuming, perhaps
hard, and not always fun. It can be taxing, especially on new
DMs. For more simple campaigns, all you need are a map of a city,
keys to the important buildings and NPCs, and well-written adventures.
<P>
Don't try to get to details before even sitting down to play.
Even for the longest campaigns, all you will need at first are
some basic notes about the ecology, geography, and information
on the nation in which your players will start, and notes about
the nations around it.
<P>
As you play adventures, and your players explore the world, your
world will grow. For example, if a major villain in an adventure
is from a distant country, you'll write things up about that country.
Eventually, you will (or will not) detail most of the initial
world you imagined.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528080">For the Novice</A></H2>

<P>
This may all seem a bit to hard for you. Don't worry, there's
another, excellent approach. It doesn't need much explanation,
so I'll outline it below:
<UL>
<LI>Don't bother creating new races, religions or whatever.
<LI>Don't bother about cosmology.
<LI>Don't bother about the culture of a country 500 miles away.
<LI>Use a feudal society, with standard adnd ideas (level 9 wizards,
magic not too common but not feared very much, standard adnd equipment
lists, things like that).
<LI>Create only one nation, and don't bother about holidays, clothing,
calendars, trade partners, education, and stuff like that.
<LI>Detail a single small city or village.
<LI>Detail a single dungeon or other adventure site.
<LI>Write one adventure.
<LI>Roll up characters.
<LI>Of you GO!
</UL>

<P>
With this approach, you'll save yourself a lot of work. As your
campaign matures, you can develop other nations, and define the
rest of the world. Your players can have a lot of influence on
the game this way. It will be harder to keep everything consistent
and logical, but it sure is easier.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528081">The World of Drakin</A></H2>

<P>
I might just have got you interested in that nice little world.
At the time that I'm writing this, I have just finished the basic
material and sent it out into the world. You can find it all at
<P>
<U>www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arena/6180/index.html</U>
<P>
The initial material I had on the world before the players rolled
up the character was about 75 typed A4s. By the time the got to
third level, that amount was doubled. Take this piece of advice
from me: the larger you start, the more rewarding it will be in
the end, but the more work it will be too!
<H1><A NAME="_Toc412528082">ADVENTURES</A></H1>

<HR>

<P>
Now that you have your own custom world, it's time to write your
own adventures. This is not about writing an adventure that's
going to be used by everyone, it's about writing an adventure
that is made for one specific world, for a specific group of players.
<P>
This guide, as above, will use an example adventure. This is about
the most generic adventure I can think of, in the most generic
world possible.
<P>
With adventures, there are several types. The basic, easiest adventure
is like &quot;you see stairs running down&#133;&quot;, followed
by a dungeon with static rooms.
<P>
There are several approaches to adventure-writing that I use.
I will detail each of them:
<UL>
<LI>Hack-and-Slash
<LI>Sidetrek
<LI>Plot
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528083">Hack-and-Slash Adventures</A></H2>

<P>
When writing a basic, simple adventure, this is my usual approach:
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528084">1. Idea</A></H3>

<P>
I start with a very basic idea. This can be just about anything.
If you're out of inspiration, turn on the tv at a random time,
at a random channel. Watch for 2 minutes, and then turn it off
again. Now think of a way you can incorporate what you just saw
into an adventure.
<P>
If a tv doesn't work, take a dictionary and pick a word. Try to
write an adventure with the word in mind. If this doesn't work,
take a book, and turn the story into an adventure.
<P>
<I>We take a dictionary and flip it open at a random page. The
first word we see is &quot;temple.&quot; Not enough. We close
the book again, and pick another word: &quot;Jewel.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>So, how do you combine jewel with temple?</I>
<P>
<I>Here's the story: a rich guy (some important NPC in your campaign)
knows of a great diamond in a temple of some evil belief (or sect,
or cult&#133;) He wants it.</I>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528085">3. The Plot</A></H3>

<P>
When you have your idea, create the plot. Nothing complicated
is necessary, just give a reason why things are the way they are,
and how the players become involved.
<P>
<I>The rich guy is one of your PCs. (grin) This solves everything:
the players are involved, the PC obviously needs cash (&quot;number
one: make it so&quot;), and he hears of the diamond in an inn
or something.</I>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528086">4. The Sites</A></H3>

<P>
When you have your plot, work out the important sites that are
of value to the adventure.
<P>
<I>In our example, we'll need the inn, the temple, and the area
between the inn and the temple.</I>
<P>
Draw up the map of the sites. Now give a description of the whole
site. Something like:
<P>
<I><B>42:</B> 10'x5'x5' chamber. Smell: old; blood. No light,
very cold. Large wooden table in centre, no other furniture. Old,
dusty, thick carpet on floor. Two doors, one in each long wall.
Not locked. Nothing special. Uninhabited.</I>
<P>
Note that I do not write down who is inside the chamber. After
all, we're in a temple, and this could vary from time to time.
I do not sensory information, for htis helps describe the atmosphere.
<P>
Also give a short description of the site, who lives there, the
relation it has to the rest of the land, who built it, and stuff.
<P>
<I>Temple of Nutcheck: This temple was build over two centuries
ago by the powerful evil cleric named Nutcheck. The Gods of Evil
and Chaos were worshipped by him. Many flocked to the temple,
and Nutcheck used these men to terrorise the farmers nearby.</I>
<P>
<I>When Nutcheck died, the temple became almost abandoned, and
the people forgot of its existence. Now, a new evil cleric has
taken the temple. His name is Novak. He is building an army of
goblinoids, and has started raiding and stealing.</I>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528087">5: The People</A></H3>

<P>
Give statistics and short descriptions of the people and creatures
involved:
<P>
<I>owlbears (AC 5; MV 12&quot;; HD 5+2; hp 27, 33; #AT 3; Dmg
1-6/1-6/2-12; THAC0 15; AL N; SA hug on 18+ to hit with either
paw causes 2-16 each round until owlbear dies; SD nil)<BR>
these creatures were captured by Novak, they act as guards to
the prison cells. They are chained to the ground in room 55.</I>
<P>
Don't detail each and every person in het case of very large sites.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc412528088">6: Review</A></H3>

<P>
Make sure that everything is consistent, review the descriptions
and run your adventure!
<H2><A NAME="_Toc412528089">Sidetrek Adventures</A></H2>

<P>
Sidetrek adventures are like hack-and-slash adventures, but are
generally more difficult to write, since they shouldn't be tied
to a specific location.
<P>
Sidetrek adventures are ment to be used besides a larger adventure.
In the above example, the players could simply encounter a random
creature, or you could use a sidetrek.
<P>
When writing a Sidetrek, try to give as little details of the
surrounding area as possible. For example, if you describe a village,
don't tell that the farmers go to the market of Neverwinter once
a week, for this will tie the village to a certain place.
<P>
Do not use any special plot either. Write it as a description
of how daily life goes if the players do not arrive there. Remember,
there shouldn't be any ties to the players. Sidetreks are not
much time to write, can provide an excellent combat exercise or
delay for the players, and can be used again if players choose
to ignore them.
<P>
Here's how to write a sidetrek:
<H4><A NAME="_Toc412528090">the Site</A></H4>

<P>
Give a description of the site. Here's an example of an Ogres'
lair:
<P>
<I>OGRES' LAIR</I>
<P>
<I>The entrance to the lair is a cluster of large boulders, with
an opening large enough for a bear to fit through. Between the
boulders are the remains of several fires, as well as a few bones,
possibly from humanoids. A strong smell of sweat and rotting fruits
comes from the entrance</I>
<P>
<I>The entrance leads about 10 yards forward and several yards
down into a large, natural cave, about 25x40 feet. The cave is
not lit. On the far end of the cave is a large bed of wolf furs.
There is a small chest in a corner of the cave, next to a suit
of dwarf-sized chainmail and a large hammer.</I>
<P>
<I>The ogre will be sleeping at night, hunting or raiding in the
morning and afternoon, and otherwise will be doing something in
his lair. He lives here alone and does NOT appreciate company.</I>
<P>
This is of course a very simple example of a sidetrek, but it's
more than a random encounter.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc412528091">The NPCs</A></H4>

<P>
give a description of the involved NPCs very briefly, as above.
<H3>Adventures with Plots</H3>

<P>
Every adventure should have some kind of plot, but what I mean
here are adventures that go beyond the slay-the-villain-take-the-treasure
type of playing.
<P>
Writing an adventure with a good plot isn't very easy, but it's
not very hard either once you've mastered it. To build a good
plot, consider the following:
<UL>
<LI><B>the event:</B>  what leads up to the first encounter, the
first even? With a murder mystery, this would be the murder.
<LI><B>the campaign:</B> the adventure should fit in the overall
storyline of the campaign. If a campaign's major theme is the
players travelling the world and helping everyone out, a murder
mystery would fit in.
<LI><B>the players:</B>  an adventure works best if it somehow
incorporates the players' goals. If the players want to find a
valuable magical item, maybe the murderer used a sword of sharpness.
<LI><B>flexibility:</B>  a good plot should be flexible; you shouldn't
force players into action. Don't have the local sheriff ask the
players directly to investigate the murder, rather have them find
a clue if they don't investigate at first.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
A good adventure begins with a hook, unfolds like a novel, tests
the skills of player and character in one way or another, somehow
changes the campaign world, and is fun to play.
<P>
The main problem with an adventure plot is that the players screw
it up. A way to solve this is to have multiple villains. For example,
if the players catch the murderer to fast, perhaps there is someone
else who wants the same persons dead. Not only will this confuse
the players, it will also give them something to do. What you
should do is prepare for the worst.
<P>
To create a good plot, write up the basic sequence of events as
you expect them to happen. We'll use the murder as an example:
<UL>
<LI><I>when the players arrive in the Broken Glass Inn, the body
of the innkeeper is lying on the floor with a knife in his chest.
As the players open the door, someone slips past them, blood on
his hands (not the murderer, but he is a criminal) the murderer
actually is the innkeepers wife. His son wanted to kill him as
well, because he would gain the inn that way. His wife killed
him because she is charmed by Nuvok (</I>a vampiric wizard, arch-enemy
of the players)
<LI><I>the criminal fleeing leaves some blood on one of the PCs
coats.</I>
<LI><I>players investigate, and discover clues that lead them
to the criminal</I>
<LI><I>hopefully, they'll discover the truth about who killed
the innkeeper, for else his wife will commit more murders.</I>
<LI><I>players find out why the woman killed her husband and continue
the chase after Nuvok.</I>
</UL>

<P>
Looks like a good enough plot. The problem here is the PCs who
should investigate, if they don't, your adventure is gone. So,
find alternative ways to make it work.
<P>
<I>If they don't investigate, the sherrif will, and will discover
the blood on the coats of the players. They will get a chance
to prove their innocense by solving the murder.</I>
<P>
<I>If they chase the criminal, people will see them running with
blood on their coats from the inn&#133;see above.</I>
<P>
<I>If they, with magic or otherwise, determine the killer to soon,
the son will come under influence of Nuvok, and the killing continues.</I>
<P>
<I>If they chase Nuvok, they'll find him as he is drinking blood
of the wife, and will have to deal with her as Nuvok escapes&#133;</I>
<H2>Series of Adventures</H2>

<P>
Adventures can be linked in several ways. For example, in the
above example, the players were chasing Nuvok, and then came across
the murder. The adventures are obviously tied together. My favourite
style of adventure is the &quot;onion&quot;-style.
<P>
This way, after completing an adventure, the players find themselves
before another one. Completing this one, they have peeled away
another layer of the onion, to discover a new one.
<P>
In the above example, say that the criminal did it. After the
players solve the murder, more murders start to occur. They catch
another criminal, and discover that he was hired by the wife of
the innkeeper. They approach her, and she flees. After a wild
ride through the city, they capture her, only to discover that
she's under influence of a vampire. 
<P>
Now, they realise that Nuvok is behind all this, and learn his
location from the women. In the end, the players confront Nuvok,
and may or may not win.
<H3>Campaign Themes</H3>

<P>
Adventuring is more fun to both player and DM if there is a purpose
to it. Just going for the money  or the fame isn't enough to many
players. Encourage players to develop personal goals, and encorporate
these into your adventures.
<P>
For example, my two experienced players on the World of Drakin
have these motives: one is a wizard who wants to stop the butchering
of wizards, and the other one is a knight who wants to bring the
true Faith back to the people, and found his own faction of knights.
As you can see, quite some adventures possible here.
<P>
The use of a such motivations in most adventures you play gives
the players more satisfaction, because they make progress. Remember
that it's the struggle that's important, not the goal!
