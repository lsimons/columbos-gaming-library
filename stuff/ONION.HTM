<H1>HOW TO BUILD AND PEEL THE &QUOT;ONION LAYERS&QUOT; OF A PLOT.
</H1>

<H6>By Lane R. Whittaker [73467,40] on Compuserve RPGAMES Forum

<H2>THEORY:</H2>

<P>
Some of this has been said before, but recaps are useful.  (Besides,
it's my soapbox at the moment &lt;grin&gt;.)  Plot lines in stories
and games should be &quot;layered&quot;, i.e. as you follow up
on the clues to one thing, some other &quot;interesting&quot;
bit of information is revealed leading you to ... etc.  Eventually
the characters find themselves where the storyteller or GM wants
them to be.
<P>
There is a theory called (at least by me) &quot;the rule of five&quot;,
which goes as follows:
<P>
EVERYONE in the entire world is no more than FIVE people away
from any &quot;important&quot; person.  This means you know someone
(#1), who knows someone (#2) and would be willing to &quot;vouch&quot;
for you to them to the extent they would then be willing to &quot;pass&quot;
you along to someone else (#3) who would then accept their &quot;vouching&quot;
and pass you along until eventually you reached your desired person.
 We are talking about &quot;got to inform them about something
VITAL&quot; type of information here, not everyday gossip.  This
theory assumes that you can convince the people at each step of
the NEED to &quot;pass&quot; you along, and the vouching is more
along the lines of &quot;I believe this person to be reasonably
reliable, responsible, and not a crackpot&quot;.
<P>
Think on it.  I was surprised to realize that I am only two steps
away from the President of the United States by one route, and
three or four by another.  The point is &quot;who do the people
you know, know in turn.&quot; Regardless of the validity of the
theory, it does suggest a convenient method (in game terms) of
establishing &quot;information flow relationships&quot; of a manageable
size.
<H2>THE WORKSHEET:</H2>

<P>
Theory is all fine and dandy, but putting it into actual practice
is something else.  You see, there's this tendency on the part
of people to want to &quot;get to the GOOD parts&quot; as quickly
as possible.  GMs are no more immune to this than anyone else,
and then they also have this tendency to &quot;wing it&quot; rather
than sit down and figure out how everyone relates to each other.
 This results in a tendency to reveal elements of the plot chain
too quickly, which leads to players forgetting or failing to attach
the same importance to some bit of information which the GM regarded
as &quot;crucial&quot;.  So how do we control and organize the
distribution of plot leads?  (Thought I'd never get to it, didn't
you?  :-)
<P>
The following is based upon a chart (and probably some theory)
which was included in the little known (and out of print for many
years) game called &quot;Legacy&quot;.  The chart was originally
designed to show &quot;relationships&quot; of individuals.  I
think of plot lines as &quot;information flow relationships&quot;
and find the chart works equally well for showing the layers of
our &quot;data onion&quot;, so I am going to describe it.  (Now
class, get out our drawing compass' and a ruler and paper.)
<P>
First (starting at least four inches in from any edges) set your
compass for a one inch separation, and draw a two inch diameter
circle.  (Those of you who can print character names in 12 pitch/Elite
size type can make it a smaller diameter.)  The dot in the center
where you buried the point of the compass and tore up the paper
represents a specific individual who is at the center of your
plot.  (You know, the arch villian - Darth Vader, evil nasty,
Doctor Death, whomever.)
<P>
If you have more than one central conspirator, don't worry, you
can develop similar charts for them as well.  (Don't groan, you
are going to WANT to by the time I'm done.  Trust me.  &lt;evil
grin&gt;)  So we don't get confused, go ahead and place the name
of this noteworthy individual at the top of the sheet of paper.
 These are THEIR relationships, at least as far as this conspiracy
goes.
<P>
Now spread your compass legs another &#189; inch apart (more if
you can only print in large size letters) and draw another circle
around the first.  We have now formed the space for the &quot;first
ring&quot; or &quot;inner circle&quot; of this individual's relationships
in the space between the two circles.  Now proceed to drawing
ever expanding (by &#189; inch or whatever) circles until you
have five such &quot;rings&quot;.
<P>
Take your ruler and &quot;quarter&quot; the entire set of circles,
like cutting a pie.  Now biset the quarters, turning them into
eighths.  (Class may now put away the compass and ruler, except
for those of you who need to start over.  They should go back
and follow directions.  You know who you are.  ;-)
<H2>GLOSSARY:</H2>

<P>
Some terminology.  When we talk of &quot;rings&quot;, we will
be counting from the center outward.  When we talk of &quot;layers&quot;,
we will be counting from the outside inward.  Layers for &quot;peeling
the onion&quot;, and &quot;rings&quot; of peel from the &quot;core&quot;.
 Circles will be obvious from the context.  The lines making up
the &quot;pie slices&quot; are called &quot;wedges&quot;.   The
&quot;boxes&quot; formed by the sides of the wedges and the ring
lines themselves will be called a &quot;cell&quot;.  Cells which
touch each other at any point, sides or corners, horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally, are called &quot;sources&quot; or &quot;contacts&quot;.
 Got all that?  Check back here if you get confused, that's why
we write things down.
<H2>BUILDING THE ONION (First ring):</H2>

<P>
Now, think of a plot, any plot, even a (*gasp*) &quot;current&quot;
story-line plot.  Remember that we are talking about a specific
individual at the center of the plot.  Now think of whom besides
that individual knows the MOST about that plot.  Who are the fellow
co-conspirators, or the chief henchmen or agents, etc.  Don't
forget those who know as much but are not &quot;members&quot;
of the plot.  These names go into the first ring, one to each
cell.  Which wedge doesn't make any difference at this point,
but bear in mind that we will be using adjacent cells to indicate
that individuals &quot;know&quot; each other.
<P>
Too many people?  Rethink how much knowledge of the plot each
has.  Relegate some individuals with lessor knowledge to later,
outer rings.  If absolutely necessary, subdivide a cell.  Just
remember that &quot;fewer is better&quot; where keeping a secret
is concerned.  The level of secrecy is inversely proportional
to the number of individuals who know &quot;the secret&quot;.
 You DON'T have to fill every cell with a name, either now or
later.
<H2>BUILDING THE ONION (Second ring):</H2>

<P>
Each &quot;ring&quot; outward is for people with some, but lesser
amounts of information about the plot than those one layer &quot;inward&quot;.
 In the second ring you will want to place &quot;knowing agents&quot;,
people who have some idea of what they are doing, but maybe without
the &quot;big picture&quot;.  Some, but few, &quot;unknowing agents&quot;
may exist here as well.  However, unknowing agents too close to
the center of a conspiracy are a significant risk which any smart
villian will avoid.  Unknowing agents will not &quot;protect&quot;
secrets they don't know are &quot;SECRETS&quot;.  (Of course the
inner rings will kill them if they represent too much of a risk,
which is a clue in itself.)
<P>
Here (in the second ring) you will want to place individuals carefully,
with individuals who know each other and possessing the same degree
of &quot;critical&quot; (though possibly different) knowledge
in the same ring in adjacent cells.  The person &quot;inward&quot;
of each of them within the same wedge is the individual they have
derived the majority of their information about the plot from.
 They can have no MORE information than their sources, but their
sources may include DIAGONALLY as well as HORIZONTALLY adjacent
cells.  This could lead to them having more accumulated, but even
more fragmentary, knowledge than their direct source.
<P>
How much any individual knows is directly dependent upon how much
each individual inward or adjacent REVEALS about &quot;the secret&quot;.
 If you wish to indicate that someone does NOT know or have contact
with an adjacent cell, I suggest making a small cell out of the
ends or corners of the respective cells.  An empty cell between
will indicate &quot;no connection or contact&quot;.
<P>
All of the people &quot;touching&quot; each other's cell at this
(or any other ring) may not &quot;know&quot; that they have knowledge
pertinent to a conspiracy.  They may not even be &quot;friendly&quot;
with each other.  Use some sort of coding (colors look pretty)
to indicate attitude or &quot;conciousness&quot; or whatever.
 REMEMBER, we are showing KNOWLEDGE relationships here, not intimacy
relationships.  (You can use the same gimmick for those, but use
another chart.  Avoid the temptation to place too much data, especially
if unrelated, on one sheet.  It becomes crowded enough rather
quickly as it is.)
<P>
Think carefully on what information is known by individuals in
each cell.  A wedge represents a &quot;direct chain of data flow&quot;.
 It helps to &quot;restrict&quot; what each individual in each
layer knows by what the individual in the inner ring reveals.
 Starting with the first ring, decide what each cell occupant
knows and how much they will reveal to the individual in EACH
of the adjacent cells.  Don't worry if the percentages of information
revealled totals more or less than 100%.  Each amount of &quot;data
flow&quot; is discrete and independent of the others.
<P>
My initial thoughts on coding here run towards categorizing the
type of information elements which are important by the &quot;who,
what, why, when, where, and how&quot; elements of a story.  (I
thought there were seven elements, but I can't think of a seventh.)
 Assign a code to each element, and a percentage of that information
which will be &quot;released&quot; to each &quot;contact&quot;
in an adjacent cell.  LIST ALL YOUR CODE MEANINGS ON THE SHEET.
<P>
The percentage might vary by contact, but the combined total for
an effective conspirator should probably not exceed 100%.  Remember
that each of the inner circle conspirators probably has responsibility
for only a particular part of the elements of the plot.  This
will restrict what they feel is necessary to pass on to their
&quot;contacts&quot;.
<H2>BUILDING THE ONION (Third ring):</H2>

<P>
Repeat the process given for the second ring in the third ring.
 Here though, you might decide to place the names of &quot;groups&quot;
as well as individuals.  The third ring should contain &quot;hired
muscle&quot; and &quot;unknowing agents&quot;, even individuals
who are being manipulated by the conspiracy.  But they will probably
have some degree of &quot;loyalty or trust&quot; in their second
ring contacts.  Bear in mind that these third ring contacts will
be the &quot;leads&quot; the PCs will follow to the second ring,
where individuals with &quot;real&quot; knowledge of the conspiracy
reside.  They will be the primary sources of &quot;significant
names and data&quot;.
<P>
Build your third ring carefully.  Contacts in the third ring will
not be &quot;guarding secrets&quot; unless they are &quot;hirelings&quot;.
 While it will take some work on the part of the PCs, these contacts
should be &quot;relatively easy nuts to crack&quot;.  Use the
codes and percentages from ALL the adjacent cells in deciding
what knowledge and how much is available to these contacts.  Then
determine how much they will be letting on to the fourth ring.
 Code it in as well.
<H2>BUILDING THE ONION (Fourth ring):</H2>

<P>
At this point you should decide if the contacts in the fourth
ring have any DIRECT knowledge of the plot at all.  They may only
have a chance of knowing some bit of information which, when interpreted
properly, could lead to the next layer as the &quot;source&quot;
of that bit of data.  Folks in this ring should not know that
their information is &quot;significant&quot; and they will (more
or less) freely divulge it and the source to the PCs.
<P>
It might make sense for the fourth ring cell to actually be a
group rather than an individual.  You should then decide how many
members of the group can direct the PCs to which contacts.  These
numbers could make a percentage table as to which cells are next
in the chain of leads the PCs follow.  Bear in mind that it is
possible to direct the PCs back outward, but into adjacent wedge
lines of contacts.
<P>
The difficulty here for the PCs should be in simply making the
connection to the &quot;occupant&quot; of the cell in this ring,
and asking the right questions.  All that coding of what inner
contacts know and reveal pays off here.  You should know exactly
what they have available to reveal to the PCs.
<H2>BUILDING THE ONION (Fifth ring/ First layer):</H2>

<P>
The fifth ring is the first layer of the onion for the players/PCs.
 It is here where they will start their pursuit of the plot line.
 Therefor, what occupies the cells here are PLACES.  These will
be the places which friends or sources of the PCs frequent, along
with (possibly) the second layer contacts.  These sources will
be able to direct the PCs to the second layer contacts when the
PCs ask the right questions.  They only know such things as &quot;George
over there might know&quot; or &quot;is into that, try the XXX
Club&quot;.
<P>
You might wish to place codes or percentage chances in the second
layer cells indicating how often the occupant(s) will be available
to the first layer connections.  This might indicate the chance
of how often they visit a particular establishment, or see the
contact, or in general how accessible they are.  Subdividing the
first layer into many cells makes some sense here, and possibly
in the fourth ring as well, depending on how much work you want
to do.
<H2>STARTING TO PEEL THE ONION:</H2>

<P>
Everything to this point has been directed to controlling how
the plot reveals itself to the probing PCs.  But first the PCs
must be made aware that there is something to be investigated
and given a lead as to where to start.  All GMs should have some
idea already in mind on HOW to make the PCs curious.  Loads of
gimmicks exist: overheard conversations, recruitment, employment,
intercepted or misdirected messages, inheritances, etc.  Leading
the PCs to a first layer contact is, IMHO, more difficult to do
well.  If you point the PCs directly to the first layer, you still
have the problem of deciding which wedge.  Of course the source
of the lead might dictate that, but I feel it is better to let
the PCs and chance play a role.
<P>
What I suggest is assigning a percentage chance to each wedge
that when the PCs visit a location in the first layer that they
will encounter a source who can lead them to the second layer.
 (Don't worry about totalling 100% here either.  Use what seems
appropriate for the location.)  Each time the PCs visit, roll
against that chance.  When the PCs get lucky, the contact will
be present who MAY reveal possession of knowledge about the &quot;information&quot;
the PCs are interested in.  Then the PCs have to follow-up with
the correct questions.
<P>
I feel the advantage to this approach is two-fold.  Firstly, there
is not only one way the PCs can get started onto the plot trail.
 There is also the chance of developing more that one trail thru
different wedges.  Secondly, the players should know that perseverence
will lead eventually to making the proper contact.  They will
then be willing to continue to circulate among the bars and clubs,
etc., spending money and building acquaintances (and entry points
to later adventures) because they will KNOW that sooner or later
they are going to connect.
<P>
The GM can abstract this readily by assuming so many visits (and
even which places if they have the players provide an &quot;itinerary&quot;)
per &quot;day&quot; and see how long it takes before the PCs get
lucky.  If you do so, you should also figure out how many sources
the PCs have built up by this process.
<H2>PEELING THE FIRST LAYER:</H2>

<P>
Just because the contact is present, doesn't mean the PCs have
it made.  The GM should consider the nature of the contact's personality.
 What is going to cause them to reveal their knowledge to the
PCs?  At this layer it isn't going to be withheld because they
are protecting a &quot;secret&quot; they don't even know exists,
but why are they going to say anything revealing?
<P>
Will they want money, in on the action, or other &quot;conditions&quot;
attached to the knowledge or will it come out as casual gossip?
 Which source cell are they going to direct the PCs towards? 
Possibly the PCs will ask questions which will cause the contact
to direct them to another contact, or simply another first layer
location in another wedge.  Red herrings are also possible, both
here and in the second layer.   (Red-herrings at lower layers
should be deliberate evasive maneuvers.)  What are the chances
that the PCs questions will cause the contact to have &quot;second
thoughts&quot; and let the second layer contact know &quot;I sent
someone to see you about x&quot;?  When (if ever) is the center
of the conspiracy going to know that &quot;someone is on your
trail&quot;?
<H2>PEELING THE SECOND (and subsequent) LAYER(s):</H2>

<P>
There is always a question in a GMs mind whether or not it should
be harder or easier the further the PCs peel the onion.  This
is why you built up the coding of what types of data and amounts
of knowledge are available to individual cells.  Now it is not
&quot;random&quot; or &quot;opinion&quot;, but predictable.  How
hard the puzzle is depends upon how well the players construct
their &quot;model of the conspiracy&quot; from the clues they
unearth.  Do they ask the right questions?  You can tell (or know
what chance they have).  If they get sidetracked, it's their own
fault or bad luck, not &quot;evasiveness&quot; on your part. 
You can feel secure that you are being neither too easy nor too
hard on them, merely objective.
<P>
In conclusion, I hope you get the idea.  None of this is hard
and fast.  Use your imagination and modify to suit your needs.
 Let me know what works for you, as well as what didn't.  I wish
I could say I have actually used this in a game, however I can't.
 I only firmed it up recently, some of it while writing.  But
I have been exploring this concept for several years and would
absolutely be trying it if I were actually GMing.  At the least,
I hope it has stimulated you into thinking about it.

No sooner I start reading &quot;Onions&quot; and I think &quot;Hey,
this is a tree hierarchy structure. And you can have leaps, and
bridges, and ..&quot; Fortunately the little man with the rolled
up newspaper came along. Snap, Snap on the nose. &quot;Down, boy!
Down! Simplify! Simplify! Simplify!&quot; And stomps off.
<P>
So onions is great. So great I will just print it off as is and
give it to my fellow GM's. (Are you submitting this to A&amp;E?
You would get comments for the next six months on this one.)
<P>
One fun tactic that I use to disseminate information to players
is at the beginning of an &quot;episode&quot; everyone gets a
character catchup sheet. I use this to correct past mistakes,
document new spells, experience gained, etc. I also like to give
characters fill-in background information and recently heard rumors
and such. The party is usually diverse enough where there is little
over lap. Its great when one person has heard a rumor, and another
person corrects them since they are &quot;closer&quot; to the
source. Or, out of three different backgrounds people realize
&quot;something's fishy&quot;. The hardest part is to &quot;pad&quot;
all the sections equally with miscellaneous data so as to not
draw attention to the &quot;leads&quot;.
<P>
I will definitely give it a shot for my next New Port &quot;episode&quot;.

<P>
 Yeah, the tree structure was one I considered, but the circle
organization is more compact and tends to force limitations which
I think help keep things from getting out of hand.  Of course,
I think &quot;linking&quot; to another sheet centered on other
personalities is inherent in the design.
<P>
A late occurring thought that I should have stressed more was
that doing a worksheet for other &quot;first ring&quot; co-conspirators
(whom I feel have a strong probability of being &quot;significant
figures&quot; in the locality) would be useful, if only because
the degree of importance each attaches to others on individual
charts will probably vary considerably.
<P>
I have always liked that chart, struck me as the single most significant
thing out of the game.  Problem was, they just said &quot;use
this to show relationships&quot;, nothing more.  Obvious to them,
maybe, but every time I sat down and tried to use it I would get
bogged down in a morass of complexities.  It has literally taken
me years to analyze it down to the approach I presented.  It is
absolutely essential to keep a chart EXTREMELY specific to a single
individual's relationships in a very specific situation.  Different
charts for different situations.  Get carried away and you can't
put anything down because you can't figure out where anyone goes
in the different contexts on the same chart.
<P>
The &quot;catch-up sheet&quot; sounds like a good idea.  If nothing
else, it forces the GM to go over what happened and &quot;note&quot;
those events which should have &quot;repercussions&quot; down
thru the time-line.  Should be great for stimulating &quot;follow-on&quot;
plots.

 Re: Tree vs Circle? That's why I have this little old man with
the rolled up
<P>
 newspaper. I tend to get too bogged down in trivial details and
never really complete the totality until I say &quot;Hold it!
Time to Hack and Slash the fluff from this concept.&quot; The
Circle is just fine. Save the tree for when you get a Mac and
Hypercard (ever since I tapped into that thread I practically
drool at the possibilities).

 Very nice paradigm for designing the schema for a game. I do
see a need for some modification of the design though:
<P>
I believe that often the center point of your innermost circle
may well be a symbol ... or a philosophy ... or an institution.
<P>
ie, if the evil guy is the head priest of the cult of Ambra, the
head priest is not really the hub. Neither truly is the god Ambra.
Rather at the center is the symbolic aspects of the headpriest's
office. He is the primary recepient of the power, and therefore
is first among those in the second level. But by the nature of
institutions, there could be those who bow to the office but do
not acknowledge the person. [sort of beaurocrat type people].
And the 'evil' would have atleast two faces; one the human one,
due to the ambitions of the head priest, and the other due to
the ambitions of the institution itself.
<P>
As an aside-do you think that this idea of creating the onion
and then letting the players cut their way into it, will work
in a messsage format? I think that in this medium, the GM cannot
afford the slowing down of the pace that would result. You need
to give choices, yes. But it is hard to give choices that would
neither be good nor bad. Just pointless.
<HR>

<P>
 Very interesting point, hari, just as I thought when I first
saw it.  Just how do we diagram it when an abstract is at the
center of the plot?  (At least that's what I see in common among
the examples you cited, even the &quot;institution&quot;.)
<P>
First of all, we mustn't lose sight of the fact that this is a
TOOL for the GM to help keep track of the complexities of THEIR
plots.  Now if the GM wants to have an abstract at the center
of the plot, there is no reason not too and a lot of reasons to
do so.
<P>
But no PC (or player, for that matter) is going to be able to
&quot;defeat&quot; an abstract, merely the &quot;adherents&quot;.
 Ideas don't die, only those who support, detract, believe in,
reject, nurture, suppress, dream of, hate, and otherwise propogate
the ideas.  Now if the GM WANTS for the PCs to &quot;kill a ghod&quot;
(didn't we already cover that &lt;grin&gt;?) then it would seem
perfectly appropriate to me to place that diety as the &quot;center&quot;
of the plot.  But then the diety is involved in a material manner,
not as an abstract figurehead.  The GM has made the diety &quot;at
risk&quot;.  No way that can take place without their involvement
in such a &quot;life and death&quot; struggle.
<P>
Otherwise, the &quot;priests&quot; of whatever level who are &quot;pushing&quot;
the plot activities forward should be considered at the center
of the doings.  It is they who have &quot;plans&quot;, different
and varying, not an abstract concept.  Behind every plot is SOMEONE
with a motive.  That is what the PCs are trying to thwart.
<P>
This brings up an issue which I may have failed to make clear
enough originally.  I envision making more than one such chart
for most plots, especially if they are of any degree of complexity
above &quot;now we all rush the palace and stab the king.  Go!&quot;.
 It seems to me that it will be useful to a GM to make a chart
with each of the &quot;inner circle&quot; at the center.  There
are several reasons for this.
<P>
Firstly, each of these &quot;co-conspirators&quot; may fondly
imagine themselves as the &quot;keystone&quot; of the plot.  Secondly,
each will almost certainly employ different agents than the others.
 The more responsibility a conspirator has, the more likely that
multiple agents will be needed.  As a side benefit, I find that
complex plots (the sort that REALLY need this kind of documenting)
tend to be the &quot;domain&quot; of powerful individuals who
are frequently important parts of the social and political structure
in the community.  Charting out each of the individuals of the
&quot;inner circle&quot; and whom each &quot;contacts&quot; should
provide the GM with an interesting addition to their &quot;social
hierarchy&quot; documentation.  It would certainly serve to help
delineate the political forces, at a minimum.
<P>
Also the more a clever conspirator wishes to distance themself
from possible implication if things go wrong, the more &quot;layers&quot;
they will &quot;insulate&quot; themself with.  (Inside of one
onion is another, and inside of that ...)  Of course, the more
likely that things will go wrong or be exposed under such detached
control, but that might be part of their &quot;personal&quot;
plotting anyway.  (&quot;If their plot works, fine.  If not, I'm
insulated and they are eliminated as 'competition'.&quot;)  This
relates to your point about more than one &quot;face&quot; to
a plot, there can certainly be more that one &quot;plot&quot;
going inside of another.  But they really are two different plots
(each with their own chart), they merely have various &quot;means
and goals&quot; in common.
<P>
With a plot line requiring more than one chart to track all the
interconnecting relationships, I would suggest: build them one
ring at a time, the same ring for each chart.  Thus when building
the third ring, the &quot;adjacent&quot; occupants can provide
the linkages to another second or third ring individual's related
chart but perhaps by linking in thru another wedge.  The same
will hold true at the fourth and perhaps even the fifth rings.
 Don't be afraid to leave LOTS of blank cells.  They can always
be filled in profitably when circumstances (and game play) dictate.
<P>
RE: your aside.  Yes, I think this &quot;onion&quot; approach
will work in a message
<P>
 format.  I agree with you that since that format takes considerably
more time than FTF the &quot;red-herrings&quot; should be kept
to a minimum.  But players do tend to treat everything the GM
spends any time describing as &quot;significant&quot;.  Some degree
of &quot;camouflaging&quot; is necessary, and should never be
pointless.
<P>
If nothing else, a &quot;red-herring&quot; should &quot;teach&quot;
the character something about the situation, even if only &quot;why&quot;
they have gotten off track.  At least show them the &quot;city
sights&quot;.  So much of the message format game is done in &quot;general
instructions&quot; and &quot;abstract&quot; that the GM has to
give the player credit for &quot;effort in the right direction&quot;.
 There are any number of things which the PC is picking up on
that would lead a &quot;real person&quot; in the situation toward
the next &quot;layer of the onion&quot; but are much too trivial
to include in a message.
<P>
I reasonably expect (despite an almost total lack of experience
with message games) that this &quot;charting&quot; approach will
not slow things up materially (or if it does so it will be to
the improvement of games advancing along the plot line too rapidly)
and may even speed slow ones up by helping the GM keep their attention
focussed on what is important to the advancement of the plot line.
 Having a &quot;script&quot; of any sort is always useful.  The
real key IMHO is:  Do the players find it more enjoyable or less?
 That depends on whether they like to unravel plots or prefer
to &quot;get in there and make 'em taste cold steel&quot;.  Different
strokes for different folks.

RE: The onion concept in message gaming.
<P>
Yes Hari, I think it will work.  While I did not go to the lengths
that Lane has suggested (although he has given me some ideas about
better organization of what I do have) this is exactly what my
campaign is all about, and it is done in the message format.
<P>
With that said, let me clarify that I understand the problems
of pacing.  IOM has been progressing since the first of November,
and a grand total of five game days has taken place.  But this
hasn't really been a problem thus far since all the players are
playing solo.  With a major city as a center piece to the world,
such is possible without the players getting frustrated or running
out of leads.
<P>
As Lane will attest from recent history, I have plot leads scattered
everywhere...it just depends on who gets there first with the
right cleverness. But there are many more &quot;pointless&quot;
leads which have significance only in life experience to that
character.  I have two players in the City right now content only
to thieve and pickpockets.  They're having a blast just roleplaying
and figuring out how to outwit and outrun the city militia.  In
other words, just because they're pointless doesn't make them
boring roleplaying.
<P>
I think though that even in party adventures the idea works. 
Without the complications of a major city, party members who have
a sufficient background should know someone who knows someone
who knows someone.  My idea in IOM is to eventually have the players
meet (either by chance or through appropriate want ads in my city
newspaper) and start swapping stories.  If I play things out correctly,
every player should be able to answer a nagging question of another
player, and only when all their individual experiences are put
together will that layer of the onion peel.  An adventure which
starts as a party exploration could easily work on the same concept.
 As I said, just because the lead doesn't directly lead you to
the answer doesn't take the fun out of playing that lead until
it runs dry.
<P>
Admittedly, this type of detailed gaming is not for everyone (especially
for a DM who wants any kind of social life outside the complexities
of his game), but I still find it the most satisfying.

 First (looking haughty and disturbed), if you go traipsing back
through alot of old messages it was I who spoke of onions and
other vegetables!!!! Give me my onion back! (big silly grin)
<P>
But more seriously, I have just finished downloading and reading
most of your peeling onion thread, and have decided to make a
few comments...
<P>
and reply to a couple of replies while I am at it.
<P>
The Rule of Five is not some abstract or theoretical instance.
 Not too long ago there was an experiment done, in which a large
number of people were chosen randomly, most on the east coast.
 They were each given a letter, and told that the letter had to
be delivered to a person on the west coast.  This person was not
known to the first person, and each originator had a distinct
destination.  The one rule was that the letter must be hand delivered,
and that the first person could not personally deliver the letter;
instead he had to ask someone he knew to either deliver the letter,
or get the letter to some third, fourth, usw, person who could
hand deliver the letter.  At the end of the experiment, all the
letters were delivered, and the average number of people involved
in each chain was only four to five people.
<P>
I have used the onion technique GMing for several years now. 
Simply put, it works.  What I find really intriguing is the graphic
technique you use to illustrate and develop the onion.  That make
a lot of sense to me, and I think it is a very good way to illustrate
the particular plot situation.  My onions were always a bit more
conceptual, and thus more written verbiage than your (and legacys)
compact diagram.
<P>
As for the onion theory working on the message board, I feel that
not only can it be very successful, but it has already proven
itself successful several times in my own Heartwood campaign.
 Perhaps the most densely layered scenario was the one which opened
The Heartwood:  not only did each layer of the onion serve to
introduce the next layer of the plot, but each layer and/or cell
served to introduce the new players to the various cultural facets
and factions of the greater Heartwood environment.  Indeed, they
are still seeing the repercussions of their unpeeling that first
onion.
<P>
The only shortcomming that your onion model has is that it excellently
represents the layering of a single plot.  And while you may have
onions within onions within other seperate onions, the model is
basically one dimensional...everything heads in.
<P>
And yes, I realize that you never intended for an onion to stand
alone, perhaps there is a better model for relating onions than
just another onion...
<P>
The tool I use comes from my design experience:  the bubble diagram.
 It is a much more flexible graphic means of representing a series
of relationships, and can describe a much more complex series
of relationships than the onion.
<P>
The problem, however, is describing exactly what and how a bubble
diagram works. It is a much more conceptual approach to organizing
a set of relationships, and can be &quot;coded&quot; and organized
in as many ways as one can imagine.
<P>
But here goes...
<P>
First get your piece of paper.  Draw a circle right in the middle
of it.  Do not use a compass, in fact, use a magic marker. (Often
the fatter the marker is, the easier it is to use to diagram!)
 This odd shaped circle is a bubble.  A bubble can represent anything.
 A person, a historical occurance, an institution, a part of an
institution, or (and this is especially useful) a bubble can represent
on of your completed Onions.
<P>
Write its name anywhere within it.
<P>
Second, draw another bubble ANYWHERE on the paper.  This represents
another person, institution, or Onion.  And name it too.
<P>
Take a second, however, to think before you place that second
bubble.  It can be placed anywhere...yet where you place it can
mean a vast majority of things if you wish.  Examples: two bubbles
close to each other might be very closely related, farther apart
more distant or even almost unrelated.  A bubble (or bubbles)
can be inside an even bigger bubble, which could represent different
factions within a single institution, and describing their interelationships.
<P>
Then connect the bubbles.  And how you connect them is very important.
 The techniques I use revolve around different types of lines
and arrows.  A line with a single headed arrow means that this
bubble knows about the other bubble, and that actions in the first
bubble will affect the second bubble.  The second bubble might
not even know of the first bubble's influence.  A double headed
arrow often means that actions in either bubble effect either
bubble.  A solid line denotes a close relationship, and the heavier
the line the stronger the connection.  A dashed line often means
that the two bubble are related in a nonobvious means.  The trick
here is to develop a vocabulary of lines and line types which
describe a certain relationship between two bubbles.
<P>
Color can also be added to the diagram to add a further level
of complexity...  such as all green bubbles belong to such and
such a concept, etc.
<P>
(often I use square bubbles to represent historical events (milestones)
which will influence other bubbles)
<P>
Then just draw and connect bubbles as needed.  Where in the onion
there is a central focus to the diagram, this does not need to
be the case in a bubble diagram.  It can track relationships in
as many directions as you can keep track of.
<P>
In actuality, this process often works out in reverse...you know
you have a series of entitys...Onions, institutions, actions,
people...so you draw all the bubbles and then figure out how they
interelate.  I often find tracing paper good for this...its cheap,
takes marker real well, and when you are refining your diagram
you can redraw the new one by tracing over the old one.
<P>
The danger of this is to try to add too much to the diagram, and
the interelationships become so complicated that it becomes illegible.
 The trick to organizing this is to be very careful at the scale
of which one is dealing.
<P>
When one is dealing with the diagram of campaign, then perhaps
the bubbles represent not Onions, but a group of onions in a particular
locale (for example) or perhaps each bubble represents an adventure
within the campaign.  Here the bubble diagram represents the relationships
between the adventures only on a large scale.  Then, if one wants
to take a closer look at one adventure, one has a second diagram
which represents the components of that adventure... it is the
bubble diagram of a bubble from the campaign scale diagram!
<P>
In this more detailed diagram, each bubble might represent a single
Onion.
<P>
Und so weiter...
<P>
Just like the onion, the bubble diagram is a tool to organize
the complex components of a particular situation.  How you develop
your own bubble diagram vocabulary is very user dependent.  Its
strongest and weakest point is its flexibility in language and
description.  If your diagram is too general, it will not provide
any meaningful information, yet if it is too complicated it is
unreadable.
<P>
The second thing to remember is that, like the onion, it only
shows the relationships between entitys.  How the players navigate
through these relationships is their own choice.  All these arrows
and connecting lines just determine how things interelate...they
are not, and should never, be construed to direct the plot of
a campaign, adventure, or scenario.
<P>
A last few items to be considered.
<P>
I have a Rule of Three.  That is, in each particular scenario
or adventure there are ATLEAST three distinct plot line occuring.
 They usually can be defined as:
<P>
one:   the main plotline of the scenario two:   a subplot which
relates in
<P>
some way to the main scenario three: a totally unrelated subplot
which is just
<P>
occuring at the same time
<P>
       and the same place
<P>
Having three seperate things going on provide several benefits:
 First, it
<P>
gives density to the action, that things are occuring that do
not directly
<P>
interelate with the adventure...preventing the &quot;if something
is occuring it
<P>
HAS TO be part of the adventure syndrome&quot;  and the &quot;whole
village centered
<P>
around the scenario syndrome.&quot;  Second, it gives the party
other alternatives
<P>
to solving the problem if onion one doesn't work, perhaps onion
two will.  And
<P>
third, the third plotline can often be used to bring in information
about the
<P>
greater world, or to become a hook for the next adventure.
<P>
As I said, a minimum of three is what I recommend.  Three Onions
interelated
<P>
in a Bubble Diagram.  As for that HWD introductory scenario, we
stopped
<P>
counting plotlines at five...(grin)
<P>
there is another reason why the onion model is appropriate...peeling
an onion
<P>
often brings on tears...

 YES!  Forgot all about bubble diagrams, but they are terrific,
just as you described.  I agree the two methods complement each
other, quite well in my opinion.
<P>
I think your &quot;rule of three&quot; is excellent.  It is that
feeling that &quot;something else is going on around me&quot;
which is essential to making a campaign &quot;come alive&quot;.
 Having three plots peeling at the same time is a good way to
do this without being too many for the GM to track.

 OK Lane.  Some initial thoughts, although I'm sure as the thread
progresses I will have more.
<P>
First, let me say this is great stuff.  As you might suspect you
and I have many of the same ideas on campaign plots, although
I have never actually sat down and thought out how to make it
work effectively.  In IOM I have simply scattered leads all over
the City (and country, as one player is presently finding out),
regardless of how important or close that lead was to the real
plot.  Whoever found it could do with it what they could.  My
problem has been that players do not always do what you expect,
and as a result, may find something too early or ignore it without
realizing its importance.
<P>
There are however many things that I have done which agree with
your approach.  &quot;Invasion of Mylar&quot; started out simply
as an intriguing title which I tied to a intriguing plot.  I then
organized a City around an old Judges Guild map, and then sprinkled
the various clues to that plot throughout the country and City.
No one clue told the whole story, and if the players did what
I thought they would, the layers of the onion would be peeled
in order.
<P>
My biggest fear has been (which my adoption of some of your ideas
will hopefully prevent) that a character would find out too much
too early and take on more than he could chew.  The powers that
battle for control of Mylar are great, and I didn't want some
player character armed with some lucky guesses presuming he could
attack them until ready.  The concepts you have outlined should
sufficiently &quot;insulate&quot; the PC's from the danger of
this happening.
<P>
I do disagree with one thing however.  While the &quot;five layer
onion&quot; may be sufficient for a single adventure or mini-plot,
I'm not sure that a DM should feel constrained by it because of
the nature of some of the games.  Five steps to enlightenment
is simply not enough adventuring for a character to build enough
&quot;experience points&quot; (or whatever) to gain levels.  When
the final showdown happens in Mylar, I want the PC's &quot;up
there&quot; in levels.  Perhaps it might be better to think of
things as a *series* of five layer onions, with each onion representing
a major milestone towards the higher purpose.  I'm reminded of
an interview I once read with Arthur C. Clarke of &quot;2001&quot;
fame.  To him a novel which answered all questions was useless.
 To him the ideal would be to have the novel solve the initial
problem, but as a result of solving it, raise another question
which naturally leads to a new set of situations.

I see a couple of practical, technical problems here...
<P>
First, if &quot;each player has the answer to another player's
nagging question&quot;, you are making some assumptions.  One,
that players will HAVE nagging questions; some prefer to play
very straightforward characters where they can just do, and let
others think.  Two, that all the players will be active, and find
out the answers to the others questions.  Three, that the players
will travel in different social circles, which may or may not
be true.
<P>
Second, I see a problem of time scale entering in.  If everybody
is off doing their own thing, it's hard to keep all the players
on the same game day.  I have a similar problem; what sort of
works in my campaign is that the players meet for dinner most
evenings, and (sometimes) discuss what they have learned and what
they plan.  But some sort of mechanism for keeping people more
or less together, timewise, is necessary, if you are going to
allow players to interact with each other.

Assumptions-I'll admit.  I am making a few about my players. 
So far, the calibur of play on this forum has indicated to me
that the players tend not to play the more passive types.  But
that is coming from experience in IOM, which has some *very* good
players who like taking the initiative.  And to be perfectly honest,
when I ran this campaign F-T-F in college, I ran into some of
the problems you mentioned.  My only real answer is that the info
is available to *everyone*, and the only reason that players have
answers to other player's questions is that they have chosen to
follow up different leads.  Not a single one of the characters
in IOM has taken the same route, and yet everyone has started
with the same basic knowledge (give or take some personal and
social contacts).  I have purposely avoided characters starting
out with the same contacts in the City by design.  If they choose
to get together in a &quot;social circle&quot; then that is great.
 The principle still holds.
<P>
This does however raise the problem of whether this concept will
work outside a solo type adventure.  Between you and Mari, I'm
not as sure anymore.
<P>
RE: Time frame.  As you know, I had some problems with that at
first.  Since
<P>
 we went to the new time system, things seem to have smoothed
out, and everyone is staying on the same game day (although as
the moves have been more complex, the &quot;days&quot; are taking
longer to execute).  The newspaper (The Sentinel) has been designed
now to cover one game day, and the players now know that all moves
for a particular day have been completed when an issue hits the
Libs.  Again this unity may be in large part due to my fortunate
position in having extremely good and regular players who post
like clockwork.  If this were not the case, I could perhaps see
a major problem arising.
<P>
Fm: Alex/Ass't SysOp 70411,351

 The caliber of play here on the Forum is a lot higher than your
average game club, true.  However, not everybody can be very active
all the time; over time some players will have account problems,
lose interest, and so forth.  If it's a good game, the majority
will still stay very interested; I'm just saying this might be
a problem in the future.
