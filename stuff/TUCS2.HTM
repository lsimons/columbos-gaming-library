<H2><A NAME="_Toc414002533">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
The original Time Unit Combat System did away with the round system
of AD&amp;D, making it an ever-ongoing fight. One would use TUs
(Time Units - 6 sec), instead of rounds. However, me and my playing
group were all used to using combat and tactics rules (using phases.)
<P>
If you do not use these rules, download <I>http://onyx.arts.kuleuven.ac.be/~ezra/gnba/books/~olear/ADnD/Files/TUCS_RTF.zip.</I>
If you do use phases, and would like to continue using them, use
these rules. The intention of these rules is:
<OL>
<LI>Make the system faster to play than the combat and tactics
system
<LI>Make players more observant during combat.
<LI>Make use of original rules, so minimising the changes.
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="_Toc414002534">The Phase System</A></H2>

<P>
There is really only one adaptation you should make: stop thinking
in rounds, start thinking in phases.  We get rid of the rounds.
Instead, the DM will start counting the Phases (starting with
phase 1 and going upwards.) This makes battle an ongoing activity,
no pauses caused by rounds - there aren't any.
<P>
To decide when an action occurs, do the following:
<OL>
<LI>roll 1d6 initiative
<LI>add modifiers
</OL>

<P>

<P>
Here is an example of how it should go:
<P>
The DM starts counting at the beginning of the battle (phase 0.)
Tarus the Mage wants to cast magic missile (ini fast) at an orc.
He rolls a 3 for initiative (on 1d6.) Adding 2 for a fast attack
means that he will cast his spell in phase (0+2+3=) 5. When he
has cast his spell, Tarus can choose another action and roll initiative
again. He wants to attack another orc with his dagger (ini fast.)
He rolls a 2 for initiative, adds 2 for a fast weapon, which means
he will strike at the orc in phase (5+2+2=) 9.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414002535">Initiative Conversion</A></H3>

<P>
In the above example, Tarus' dagger had a phase modification (PM)
of 2. To find initiative modifications, use the following table:
<P>
<B>Initiative Phase Modification (PM)</B>
<P>
Strikes First 0
<P>
Very Fast 1
<P>
Fast  2
<P>
Average 3
<P>
Slow  4
<P>
Very Slow 5
<P>
Strikes Last 6
<P>
<B>Initiative Phase Modification (PM)</B>
<P>
0-1  1
<P>
2-4  2  
<P>
5-7  3
<P>
8-13  4
<P>
14+  5
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002536">Multiple Attacks</A></H4>

<P>
If a character has multiple attacks, the second and following
attacks occur in subsequent phases. For example, a character who
has 3 attacks with his dagger makes his first attack as normal,
his second in the following phase, and his third in the phase
after that one.
<P>
This also applies to combinations of fighting and movement.
<P>
<I>Torran wants to attack an orc standing 4 squares away of him.
His initiative modifier is 2 (fast), and he is fighting with a
short sword.</I>
<P>
<I>In phase 4, he declares his action. He rolls a 2, and adds
2. He will make his half-move in phase 8, and he will attack in
phase 9.</I>
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002537">Attacks of Opportunity</A></H4>

<P>
Attacks of Opportunity occur in the phase that they are possible,
as normal.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc414002538">Who goes first?</A></H4>

<P>
If several action happen in the same phase, use the following
guidelines:
<OL>
<LI>shooting goes first
<LI>then comes movement (and attacks resulting from charges)
<LI>finally comes the melee
<LI>everything is resolved in order of initiative.
</OL>

<P>
If there still is a tie, then the action occur simultaneously
(or use a critical event).
<H3><A NAME="_Toc414002539">Round Conversion</A></H3>

<P>
To convert durations of spells, poison effects, etc. to phases,
use the following table:
<P>
1 standard AD&amp;D round (60 sec) = 20 phases
<P>
1 combat and tactics round (15 sec) = 5 phases
<P>
1 turn (600 sec)   = 200 phases
<P>
1 combat and tactics turn (150 sec) = 50 phases
<P>
In the combat and tactics book, one would not convert spell durations.
Here, use the standard rules on spell durations. This means that
a spell that lasts 1 round should last 5 phases, and a spell that
lasts a turn should last 50 phases. Otherwise, the balance between
spellcasters and non-spellcasters would change dramatically. (the
same rules should apply for poison onset times, too)
<P>
<I>A </I>light <I>spell that has a duration of 4 rounds will last
20 phases, starting at the phase the wizard casts the spell.</I>
<P>
<I>A </I>heat metal <I> inflicts 2d4 points of damage 15 phases
after the wizard finishes the spell, another 2d4 after 20 phases
and after 25 phases.</I>
<H2><A NAME="_Toc414002540">Example of Combat</A></H2>

<P>
Here is an example of how it works. Exactly the same example as
that used in combat and tactics is used here.
<P>
At phase=1, the DM decides that the two on the flanks will take
cover, the one in the middle flips the table for cover, his companions
close for combat, and the last bugbear is still getting out of
bed and decides to wait and see what happens.
<P>
The players state their actions:
<P>
Damiar shoots at a bugbear, Pascal closes for an attack, Lyssa
throws a sleep spell, Dain covers the hallway.
<P>
The DM rolls a 2 initiative for the bugbears, but the players
roll a 1.
<P>
<I>DM: nothing in phase 1, 2 or 3, I think. Phase 4!</I>
<P>
<I>Lyssa: my sleep spell is finished in phase 4.</I>
<P>
<I>Pascal: I start moving.</I>
<P>
<I>(&#133;one bugbear down&#133;)</I>
<P>
<I>Lyssa: I'm going to move into the room to find a place to cast
my next spell. </I>(rolls a 4+ phase 4+2 for being fast=10)
<P>
<I>Pascal: I'm moving! I jump on the table in front of them.</I>
<P>
<I>DM: that's phase 4. Phase 5!</I>
<P>
<I>Damiar: My bowshot is phase 5. I rolled a 20. Is that a critical
hit? (&#133;another bugbear down&#133;)</I>
<P>
<I>Pascal: I attack a bugbear (&#133;misses&#133; )I'll stand
my ground and attack (</I>rolls a 1+phase 5+3 for being average=9)
<P>
<I>DM: phase 6!</I>
<P>
<I>Damiar: we won initiative, so my second bowshot is now. (&#133;misses&#133;)
I'll shoot again </I>(rolls a 3+phase 6+2 for being fast =11<I>)</I>
<P>
<I>DM: the bugbears move under cover, and in phase 7 Pascal is
attacked&#133; a miss. </I>DM decides: bugbears remain under cover
and guard (can declare actions at any time), the bugbear attacking
Pascal takes a half-move and attacks (move=phase 6+rolls 2+3 for
being average=11, attack= phase 12), the last bugbear now decides
to join the fight (phase 6+rolls 3+3 for being average=12, attack=13)
<P>
In phase 9 Pascal attacks again and misses again. In phase 10,
Lyssa completes her movement, in phase 11 Damiar fires and hits
a bugbear. The bugbear fighting Pascal moves back. In phase 12
he attacks, and the other bugbear closes for combat as well. In
phase 13 he attacks.
<P>
I hope this makes everything clear enough.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc414002541">Other Changes</A></H2>

<H5>SURPRISE</H5>

<P>
If a group is surprised, every surpriser gets one free action,
as normal. Their initiative, in fact, is 0. They can make any
action that would normally be possible in one round.
<H5>THE FIVE STEPS</H5>

<P>
As you probably have noticed, the standard 5-step system of the
combat round do not apply anymore. The DM determines what monsters
will do when they finish their action, as do the players.
<H5>CRITICAL EVENTS</H5>

<P>
These events will be scarcer in the new system, but don't bother
with that.
<H5>ABORTING ACTIONS</H5>

<P>
In the flow of combat, characters will often abort their actions.
If so, they can do this in any phase. The character simply declares
he wants to change his action, and rolls initiative for the new
action.
<H5>RETREAT</H5>

<P>
This rule is normally not used anymore; players can force a retreat
if they opt to use a called shot or critical hit for this (the
called shot inflicts normal damage and forces a character back,
as does the critical hit).
<H5>FATIGUE</H5>

<P>
Whenever a character has completed an action, you mark of fatigue
(don't do this at the end of the combat round anymore).
<H5>MORALE</H5>

<P>
Roll a morale check on the moment one is required, not at the
end of the round.
<H2><A NAME="_Toc414002542">Notes</A></H2>

<P>
You have probably wondered why a few things are the way they are.
<P>
The most obvious one is of course the initiative: rolled on a
d6 instead of on a d10. This is because the initiative system
was meant to represent the unpredictable situation of combat.
Using a d10, rolling initiative would become more important than
rolling Thac0s; something I wanted to avoid.
<P>
The second change to the rules was that of the spell durations.
This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage, as the examples
show. But it seemed only the most logical thing to do. A combat
round has 5 phases, so a spell that has a duration of 1 round
should last for 5 phases.
