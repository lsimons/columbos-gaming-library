<B>Rules, Guidelines and information for The World of Drakin Mailing List</B><BR>
<HR>

<P>Welcome to the Drakin list, a forum for discussion about matters relating to the Dragon Kings
Campaign Setting, and to the ADND game. You will be held responsible for the information in this
document, so please read it before posting to the Drakin list.</P>

<P>this mailing list is a LISTBOT distribution list hosted at www.listbot.com. The list owner for
the Drakin List is Leo Simons. [<A HREF="MAILTO:COLUMBO@SIMONS.DEMON.NL">COLUMBO@SIMONS.DEMON.nl</A>].</P>

<P>If you wish to unsubscribe from the Drakin List, visit www.listbot.com.The information on this
site will make unsubscribing easy.</P>

<P>The TSR-official discussion list is the adnd-l. To subscribe to this list, send an e-mail with
a blank subject to LISTSERV@LISTSERV.UTA.EDU. The following should be in the body of the message:
"SUB ADND-L {yourname}".</P>

<B>DISCUSSION TOPICS</B><BR>
<HR>

<P>This list is for discussing the World of Drakin, ADND, as well as general role-playing issues. 
Posts which do not add to these subjects should not be sent to this list. Also, please avoid
sending out responses to basic questions unless your response contains new or different
information.</P>

<P>When you send e-mail to this list, it is appreciated if you use the following keywords in your
subject line:</P>

<B>[DRAKIN]</B><BR>
Please include this in ALL your mails to the list. It is very important to use this keyword.</P>

<B>ADND</B><BR>
For topics that relate to adnd rules, rulebooks, accessories, and anything else that concerns
with the adnd game in general.</P>

<B>DRAGON KINGS</B><BR>
For all topics that relate to the World of Drakin.</P>

<B>CUSTOM</B><BR>
For topics that are about things you have written or designed yourself.</P>

Here is a sample subject line should look:
"[DRAKIN] CUSTOM, ADND: my rules for mass combat"</P>

<P>Currently, the keywords above are the only ones that are permanent. Currently, this list is
used to run a project that has as a goal the creation of a gigantic, shared dungeon. For
anything related to this, please use the keyword "[dungeon]".</P>

<P>Please keep in mind, however, that learning the workings of the list can be quite a chore,
especially for those new to the internet environment. Please be patient with the newcomers.
After all, without constant infusions of new people with new insights, this list will wither
away.</P>


<B>POST CONTENTS</B><BR>
<HR>

<P>As this is a public discussion list with various and diverse members, we prefer that you avoid
the use of obscene language and exercise courtesy and common sense when posting.</P>


<B>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</B><BR>
<HR>
<P>Some mailers are less friendly than others and many people have different levels of access to
the internet. Please keep this in mind when posting to this list.  As a courtesy, please include
your name/address in the body of you message, keep the posts under 250 lines in length, limit
your lines to approximately 75 characters, and only post TEXT messages. There also is a technical
limitation: the maximum size of a message is 10KB. Below are some specific issues to consider.</P>

<B>Software Piracy</B><BR>
Any attempt to use this list to distribute pirated software will result in the offender being
removed from the list immediately.</P.

<B>Chain Letters</B><BR>
Chain letters are not tolerated on this list and will result in the offender being removed from
the list immediately.</P>

<B>Binaries/Attachments</B><BR>
DO NOT post attachments to this list.  If you have a file you wish to share and can not include
it in the body of your list email, please send out a notice to the list and send the file only to
those people who request it.</P>

<B>Trading AD&D Merchandise</B><BR>
Please do not use this list to trade or advertise for the buying and selling of ad&d or anyother
product(s).</P>

<B>Commercial Advertisements</B><BR>
Commercial Advertisemens are not tolerated and will result in the offender being removed from the
list immediately.</P>

<B>Spoilers</B><BR>
We welcome reviews about AD&D products, but some prefer not to know details about modules they
may play in the future.  If you are posting spoiler information about new gaming products, please
indicate it in the subject line, as well as mentioning it at the start of your post followed by
several blank lines to ensure that the reader doesn't accidentally see anything which might spoil
his enjoyment of the product.</P>

<B>Surveys</B><BR>
AD&D or RPG related surveys are allowed on this list.  However, all responses to the survey
should be sent to the person conducting the survey and that person is expected to share the
results of his survey with the list.</P>

<B>Test Messages</B><BR>
A single test message when you first join this list is acceptable, but please limit this as much
as you can. Note that you don't recieve a confirmation message from this list when you have
posted to this list. You only recieve a message if you posted to this list and the message was
NOT sent to this list.</P>

<B>Signatures</B><BR>
Please keep your signature files reasonable.  Huge sigs are frowned upon, especially if your
signature is consistently larger than the text of your post.</P>

<B>Quoting</B><BR>
Please quote only as much as you need in order to clearly show what the original individual
stated.  Quoting the entire message, especially including header information and the bottom
banner, is frowned upon.</P>

<B>Cross posting/Forwarding</B><BR>
Please do not forward private mail to this list or forward mail from this list to other forums
without the prior approval of the originator of the message. In particular, this is true for
messages from adnd-l, since many of this list its members are also already on that list.</P>

<B>"Me Too"/one line posts</B><BR>
Please don't waste the lists time with sending posts to ADND-L which say nothing more than "Me
Too" or other such messages.  This is particularly objectionable when preceded by excessively
quoted text.</P>

<B>CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATIONS</B><BR>
<HR>
<P>This list is basically an unmoderated list. The above should be seen as guidelines only. However,
the list owner, reserves the right to remove anyone from the list he thinks has violated the
above rules in such a way that removal is justified.</P>

<P>Quite often, list members are accused of "playing list owner" by reminding other list members of
the list rules and guidelines. These actions are supported by the list owner. But it is stressed
again that learning the workings of this list can be difficult to master.</P>
